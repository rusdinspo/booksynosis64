Smith, M.D., New York Times bestselling author of Feed Your Body Right<br><br>""Syndrome X is the best new book to help you understand the facts about nutrition, health, and aging. . . . It is full of new information and insights most readers have never had access to before. Everyone who values his or her health will want to read the book and then individualize the program to suit his or her needs-the authors have made this easier than ever to do.""-Richard A. Kunin, M.D., author of Mega-Nutrition<br><br>What is Syndrome X? It's a resistance to insulin-the hormone needed to burn food for energy-combined with high cholesterol or triglycerides, high blood pressure, or too much body fat. Syndrome X ages you prematurely and significantly increases your risk of heart disease, hypertension, obesity, eye disease, nervous system disorders, diabetes, Alzheimer's, cancer, and other age-related diseases.<br><br>Syndrome X is the first book to tell you how to fight the epidemic disorder that is derailing the health of nearly a third of North Americans. It outlines a complete three-step program-including easy-to-follow diets, light physical activity, and readily available vitamins and nutritional supplements-that will safeguard you against developing Syndrome X or reverse it if you already have it.</p><p>If you're aging prematurely, getting fatter, feeling sluggish, and watching your blood pressure and cholesterol sneak upwards, you may have "Syndrome X," claim the authors, who say that up to 60 million North Americans have it. "Syndrome X is primarily a nutritional disease caused by eating the wrong foods," they write. The mysterious-sounding "Syndrome X" refers to a group of health problems including insulin resistance ("the inability to properly deal with dietary carbohydrates such as sugars"), plus at least one additional problem, such as abnormal blood fats (elevated cholesterol or triglycerides), overweight, and/or high blood pressure. Insulin resistance is "a diet-caused hormonal logjam that interferes with your body's ability to efficiently burn the food you eat." According to the authors, you probably have this problem, and if you do, eating processed carbohydrates are the root of it. Pastries, pastas, breakfast cereals, soft drinks--these refined carbos are the enemy. The book warns you that you probably suffer from insulin resistance (please get a blood test instead of relying on the admittedly unscientific questionnaire in the book, which makes everyone suspect who eats cereal or drinks fruit juice). Then the authors jump on the high-protein, low carb bandwagon. You can eat three eggs for breakfast, roast duck for lunch, and salmon for dinner, and snack on chicken slices.<p> It seems odd that if the problem is refined carbs that the solution is high protein and low carbs. The authors admit that most unrefined, or complex, carbohydrates do not have the excessive glucose- and insulin-stimulating effect of refined carbs, so why not recommend high-quality, unrefined carbohydrates (which are preferred over high-protein diets by the American Dietetic Association)? Consumers can't tell the difference, the authors say. So rather than educate them to the difference, let them eat meat. Go figure.</p>You can feel great again!<p>For years, medical researchers have been trying and failing to explain the widespread prevalence of heart disease, hypertension, diabetes, cancer, and other health problems among adults of all ages. Then, just a few years ago, a handful of enterprising scientists began to connect the dots between these seemingly disparate medical problems. A frightening pattern emerged: Syndrome X. Now, in the first book to tell you how to fight the epidemic disorder that is derailing the health of nearly a third of North Americans, find out what Syndrome X is and what you can do to protect yourself against it.</p><p>What is Syndrome X? The hallmark of Syndrome X is a resistance to insulin, the hormone that enables your body to use the energy stored in the food you eat. If you have insulin resistance together with high cholesterol, high triglycerides, high blood pressure, or too much body fat, you have Syndrome X.</p><p>How does Syndrome X affect you? It ages you prematurely, making you look and feel older than you should. It significantly increases your risk of heart disease, hypertension, obesity, eye disease, nervous system disorders, diabetes, Alzheimer&#x2019;s, cancer, and other age-related diseases. It saps your energy, dulls your mental focus, and darkens your outlook on life, leaving you depressed or subject to mood swings.</p><p>What causes Syndrome X? Eating too many processed high-carbohydrate foods such as breads, pastas, and sweets creates an excess of glucose and cell-destroying free radicals in your system, leads to insulin overload, and deprives your body of the nutrients it needs to thrive.</p><p>How can you tell if you have Syndrome X? Signs can be as simple as a spare tire around your waist, fatigue, mental fuzziness, and elevated blood pressure or cholesterol. To get a more complete picture, read this book. </p><p>It arms you with a self-test and other valuable tools for determining whether you have or are in danger of developing Syndrome X.</p><p>What can you do to fight Syndrome X? The first big step in conquering Syndrome X is reading this book. It outlines a complete, three-step program&#x2014;including easy-to-follow diets, light physical activity, and readily available vitamins and nutritional supplements&#x2014;guaranteed to safeguard you against developing Syndrome X or to reverse it if you already have it.</p></p><h2>Adventures in the Human Spirit</h2><p><b></b> Exceptionally student-friendly, extensively illustrated, and engagingly thought-provoking, this one-volume historical survey of the humanities is accessible&#x2013;and inviting&#x2013;to readers with <i>little background in the arts and humanities.</i> <b></b> Carefully balanced among the major arts, philosophy, and religion and finely focused on selected principal events, styles, movements, and figures, it brings the past to life by including authentic documents from daily life, comparative global perspectives, and examples from literature, philosophy, music&#x2013;including the contributions of women and minority artists. <b></b> For individuals waiting to discover the humanities' rich connections to their <i>own</i> lives.</p><p>Accessible to students with little background in the arts and humanities, Adventures in the Human Spirit is a highly illustrated historical survey of Western civilization, carefully balanced among the major arts, philosophy, and religion, and focused on selected principal events, styles, movements, and figures including women artists.

In my world, one does not have the luxury of an off-season. . . . This book is a must read for all those striving for the gold."-Arthur M. Blank, CEO and President, The Home Depot<br> <br> "Wow! This is an incredible book. Every person in business should read The Corporate Athlete from cover to cover and apply it every day."-Brian Tracy, author of Maximum Achievement: Strategies and Skills That Will Unlock Your Hidden Powers to Succeed<br> <br> Today's corporate world is much like the world of professional sports-it is fiercely competitive and mentally and physically demanding, and it requires constant, vigilant training. More than ever, to maintain health, happiness, and career success, executives and employees must become Corporate Athletes. In this book, top business consultant, trainer, and lecturer Jack Groppel shows you how to use the training mentality of elite professional athletes.<br> <br> Based on the latest scientific research, The Corporate Athlete shows corporate competitors how to achieve maximum performance levels-both inside and outside the corporate world. Drawing on the parallels between sports and business, Jack Groppel reveals the integral roles that nutrition, fitness, and self-improvement-mental, physical, and emotional-play in giving Corporate Athletes their winning edge. It's an edge that's crucial if you need to come to a meeting fresh off the plane, pull out all the stops on a big presentation, cut the major deals-and still have the energy to enjoy time with family and friends. This practical and beneficial 21-day program will give you, no matter how overworked you are, the stamina and commitment to develop a world-class career.<br> <br> Learn to:<br> * Have as much energy for your family at 8 p.m. as you have at the office at 8 a.m.<br> * Be on when you need to be on<br> * Respond to change, adversity, and crisis more constructively<br> * Display more positivity and confidence<br> * Eat properly on the road, in the air, and before and during business meetings<br> * Slow down the aging process<br> <br> Take advantage of the same secrets that Dr. Groppel has used to help high-stress professionals-from Olympic athletes and NHL stars to fast-lane executives at major companies like Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, Est�e Lauder, and Bristol-Myers Squibb-get themselves in fighting shape. Here is the program that will train you to perform at the highest possible levels in both your professional and your family life-because taking optimum care of yourself, mentally and physically, is the best way to take care of business.<br> <br> "Outstanding . . . The Corporate Athlete is a truly comprehensive program to help you achieve both your personal and your professional goals. It will help you take control of your life and effect positive physical, mental, and spiritual change."-Darlene Hamrock, Regional Vice President, Clinique<br> <br> Why do so many top performers call themselves Corporate Athletes?<br> <br> "Today's challenging business climate requires every top executive to be perfectly fit both mentally and physically. The Corporate Athlete is must reading for everyone who wants to manage his or her business, career, or profession effectively while living a balanced life. Buy it-it's a great investment."-Leonard Lauder, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of the Est�e Lauder Companies, Inc.<br> <br> "This is the book to teach you how to perform your job at the highest level possible while maintaining maximal health and happiness."-Jim Courier, French Open champion and former world No. 1 tennis player</p><p>Jack Groppel is a speaker-consultant on business issues and a partner in a company that helps sports stars such as Ernie Els and Monica Seles enhance their competitive edge by fine-tuning their training regimens and overall lifestyles. In <i>The Corporate Athlete</i>, he proposes a total program of nutrition, exercise, and spiritual fitness that's designed to do the same for those competing in the world of business. "Executives and employees in the new millennium can protect their health and happiness and continue to perform at high levels only by doing what athletes do--train," Groppel writes. "You must become a Corporate Athlete, which means adapting the training mentality of elite, high-performance athletes." His program is hardly "a quick fix," Groppel admits, but rather a demanding (albeit versatile) and multifaceted process with explicit short- and long-term guidelines. He clearly explains how carbohydrates and proteins, stretching and aerobic activity, and even ethics and values affect performance at work, for example, and offers practical suggestions for incorporating them into an already overcrowded day. He concludes by outlining a complete 21-day improvement program, which includes day-by-day goals for exercise and meals along with ways to track subsequent accomplishments. This book is for anyone, corporate or otherwise, looking to add balance to an otherwise stressful and hectic work life. <i>--Howard Rothman</i>Dan Jansen, Olympic Gold Medal Speed Skater<br> "Dr. Groppel applies many of the same principles and techniques that I used to help me win my gold medal to the corporate world. He will have you performing like an Olympian at the office." <p>Jodie Abendroth, Director of Operations, Peter Lowe International, Inc.<br> "Until The Corporate Athlete, I was always in a constant, unrelenting state of go, go, go! Dr. Jack Groppel's material has trained me how to pace myself both personally and professionally. This book is a must read for anyone desiring to achieve maximum productivity without hitting the burnout point. Stress becomes your ally--fulfillment becomes your reality." </p><p>Peter J. Cathey, President and CEO, World Duty Free Inflight, Inc.<br> "You cannot be intimidated by the geographical challenges of global business.

Coverage begins with the more general nonparametric point of view and then looks at parametric models as submodels of the nonparametric ones which can be described smoothly by Euclidean parameters. Although some computational issues are discussed, this is very much a book on theory. It relates theory to conceptual and technical issues encountered in practice, viewing theory as suggestive for practice, not prescriptive. It shows readers how assumptions which lead to neat theory may be unrealistic in practice. <b></b> Statistical Models, Goals, and Performance Criteria. Methods of Estimation.

These techniques often have a strong intrinsic computational component. Tomographic data are the result of mathematically based processing. Sequencing is done by applying computational algorithms to raw gel electrophoresis data. </p> <p> As a consequence the emphasis of statistical theory has shifted away from the small sample optimality results that were a major theme of our book in a number of directions:</p> <p>Methods for inference based on larger numbers of observations and minimal assumptions�asymptotic methods in non- and semiparametric models, models with "infinite" number of parameters.<br><br> The construction of models for time series, temporal spatial series, and other complex data structures using sophisticated probability modeling but again relying for analytical results on asymptotic approximation. Multiparameter models are the rule.<br><br> The use of methods of inference involving simulation as a key element such as the bootstrap and Markov Chain Monte Carlo.<br><br> The development of techniques not describable in "closed mathematical form" but rather through elaborate algorithms for which problems of existence of solutions are important and far from obvious.<br><br> The study of the interplay between numerical and statistical considerations. Despite advances in computing speed, some methods run quickly in real time. Others do not and some though theoretically attractive cannot be implemented in a human lifetime.<br><br> The study of the interplay between the number of observations and the number of parameters of a model and the beginnings of appropriate asymptotic theories.<br> </p> <p> There have, of course, been other important consequences such as the extensive development of graphical and other exploratory methods for which theoretical development and connection with mathematics have been minimal. These will not be dealt with in our work. </p> <p> As a consequence our second edition, reflecting what we now teach our graduate students, is much changed from the first. Our one long book has grown to two volumes, each to be only a little shorter than the first edition. </p> <p> Volume I, which we present in 2000, covers material we now view as important for all beginning graduate students in statistics and science and engineering graduate students whose research will involve statistics intrinsically rather than as an aid in drawing conclusions. </p> <p> In this edition we pursue our philosophy of describing the basic concepts of mathematical statistics relating theory to practice. However, our focus and order of presentation have changed. </p> <p> Volume I covers the material of Chapters 1-6 and Chapter 10 of the first edition with pieces of Chapters 7-10 and includes Appendix A on basic probability theory. However, Chapter 1 now has become part of a larger Appendix B, which includes more advanced topics from probability theory such as the multivariate Gaussian distribution, weak convergence in Euclidean spaces, and probability inequalities as well as more advanced topics in matrix theory and analysis. The latter include the principal axis and spectral theorems for Euclidean space and the elementary theory of convex functions on Rd as well as an elementary introduction to Hilbert space theory. As in the first edition, we do not require measure theory but assume from the start that our models are what we call "regular." That is, we assume either a discrete probability whose support does not depend on the parameter set, or the absolutely continuous case with a density. Hilbert space theory is not needed, but for those who know this topic Appendix B points out interesting connections to prediction and linear regression analysis. </p> <p> Appendix B is as self-contained as possible with proofs of most statements, problems, and references to the literature for proofs of the deepest results such as the spectral theorem. The reason for these additions are the changes in subject matter necessitated by the current areas of importance in the field. </p> <p> Specifically, instead of beginning with parametrized models we include from the start non- and semiparametric models, then go to parameters and parametric models stressing the role of identifiability. From the beginning we stress function-valued parameters, such as the density, and function-valued statistics, such as the empirical distribution function. We also, from the start, include examples that are important in applications, such as regression experiments. There is more material on Bayesian models and analysis. Save for these changes of emphasis the other major new elements of Chapter 1, which parallels Chapter 2 of the first edition, are an extended discussion of prediction and an expanded introduction to k-parameter exponential families. These objects that are the building blocks of most modern models require concepts involving moments of random vectors and convexity that are given in Appendix B. </p> <p> Chapter 2 of this edition parallels Chapter 3 of the first and deals with estimation. Major differences here are a greatly expanded treatment of maximum likelihood estimates (MLEs), including a complete study of MLEs in canonical k-parameter exponential families. Other novel features of this chapter include a detailed analysis including proofs of convergence of a standard but slow algorithm for computing MLEs in multiparameter exponential families and an introduction to the EM algorithm, one of the main ingredients of most modern algorithms for inference. Chapters 3 and 4 parallel the treatment of Chapters 4 and 5 of the first edition on the theory of testing and confidence regions, including some optimality theory for estimation as well and elementary robustness considerations. The main difference in our new treatment is the downplaying of unbiasedness both in estimation and testing and the presentation of the decision theory of Chapter 10 of the first edition at this stage. </p> <p> Chapter 5 of the new edition is devoted to asymptotic approximations. It includes the initial theory presented in the first edition but goes much further with proofs of consistency and asymptotic normality and optimality of maximum likelihood procedures in inference. Also new is a section relating Bayesian and frequentist inference via the Bernsteinvon Mises theorem. </p> <p> Finally, Chapter 6 is devoted to inference in multivariate (multiparameter) models. Included are asymptotic normality of maximum likelihood estimates, inference in the general linear model, Wilks theorem on the asymptotic distribution of the likelihood ratio test, the Wald and Rao statistics and associated confidence regions, and some parallels to the optimality theory and comparisons of Bayes and frequentist procedures given in the univariate case in Chapter 5. Generalized linear models are introduced as examples. Robustness from an asymptotic theory point of view appears also. This chapter uses multivariate calculus in an intrinsic way and can be viewed as an essential prerequisite for the more advanced topics of Volume II. </p> <p> As in the first edition problems play a critical role by elucidating and often substantially expanding the text. Almost all the previous ones have been kept with an approximately equal number of new ones added�to correspond to our new topics and point of view. The conventions established on footnotes and notation in the first edition remain, if somewhat augmented. </p> <p> Chapters 1-4 develop the basic principles and examples of statistics. Nevertheless, we star sections that could be omitted by instructors with a classical bent and others that could be omitted by instructors with more computational emphasis. Although we believe the material of Chapters 5 and 6 has now become fundamental, there is clearly much that could be omitted at a first reading that we also star. There are clear dependencies between starred sections that follow: 5.4.2, 5.4.3, 6.2, 6.3, 6.4, 6.5, 6.6 </p> <p> Volume II is expected to be forthcoming in 2003. Topics to be covered include permutation and rank tests and their basis in completeness and equivariance. Examples of application such as the Cox model in survival analysis, other transformation models, and the classical nonparametric k sample and independence problems will be included. Semiparametric estimation and testing will be c</p></p><h2>Taking Sides: Clashing Views in Race and Ethnicity</h2><p>The <strong>Taking Sides Collection</strong> on McGraw-Hill Create&#x2122; includes current controversial issues in a debate-style format designed to stimulate student interest and develop critical thinking skills.

In <em>White Nights</em>, the apparent idyll of the dreamer's romantic fantasies disguises profound loneliness and estrangement from "living life." <em>A Gentle Creature</em> and <em>The Dream of a Ridiculous Man</em> show how withdrawal from reality can end in spiritual desolation as well as moral indifference, and how, in Dostoevsky's view, the tragedy of the alienated individual can only be resolved by the rediscovery of a sense of compassion and responsibility toward other people.<br> No other edition brings together these specific stories--which are most interesting when read alongside one another--and the new translations capture all the power and lyricism of Dostoevsky's writing at its best.<br><br><strong>About the Series: </strong>For over 100 years <strong>Oxford World's Classics</strong> has made available the broadest spectrum of literature from around the globe.

Reprint. <i>PW. </i></p><p>In this updated version of a modern classic, acclaimed historian Arthur M. Schlesinger Jr. strikes a blow against radical multiculturalism. The rising cult of ethnicity, he argues, threatens a common American identity, imperiling the civic ideals that traditionally have bonded immigrants into a nation. Various chapters criticize bilingual education, Afrocentrism, and the use of history as group therapy for minorities. Schlesinger raised eyebrows when he first published this book in 1992 because of his impeccable liberal credentials as a one-time assistant to President Kennedy and long-standing academic champion of FDR's New Deal. This new version contains all of the original volume's edge, plus a few extras, including an appendix containing "Schlesinger's Syllabus," 13 books "indispensable to an understanding of America." Titles from this eclectic list include <i>The Federalist Papers</i>, Tocqueville's <i>Democracy in America</i>, <i>Uncle Tom's Cabin</i>, <i>The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn</i>, and Mencken's <i>American Language</i>. <i>The Disuniting of America</i> remains an essential book for readers interested in the American character as it enters the 21st century. <i>--John J.

However, there exists little to no literature designed to give timely and comprehensive help for crisis intervention teams. This is a thorough revision of the first complete and authoritative handbook that prepares the crisis counselor for rapid assessment and timely crisis intervention in the 21st century. Expanded and fully updated, the <em>Crisis Intervention Handbook: Assessment, Treatment, and Research, Third Edition</em> focuses on crisis intervention services for persons who are victims of natural disasters, school-based and home-based violence, violent crimes, and personal or family crises. It applies a unifying model of crisis intervention, making it appropriate for front-line crisis workers-clinical psychologists, social workers, psychiatric-mental health nurses, and graduate students who need to know the latest steps and methods for intervening effectively with persons in acute crisis.</p><p>D.S.W. from U. of Maryland.

The main thread that runs through Volume 2 is that manufacturing plants can be segmented into three general categories- referred to as V-plants, A-plants, and T-plants. The behavior of real-life plants can be understood in terms of combinations of these generic plant types. Recommended strategies for implementing Synchronous Managment concepts in each of these plant types is discussed. A key feature of this volume is the use of detailed case studies to illustrate systematic processes for implementing Synchronous Management along with the attendant logistical systems. Four extensive case studies are presented in this volume, each based on an actual Synchronous Management implementation. In each case, key issues and the framework for the implementation process are described. The case study is then used to illustrate these concepts and demonstrate the implementation process. Topics covered include: *<p>Misallocation Problems *</p><p>How to Classify your Plant (V-A-T) *</p><p>Implementation Issues and examples in "V" Plants *</p><p>Implementation Issues and examples in "A" Plants *</p><p>Implementation Issues and examples in "T" Plants *</p><p>General Framework for Implementing Synchronous Management</p></p><p></p><h2>N.

Individual state authors explore and explain Trump&#x2019;s triumph, redistricting battles, congressional conflicts, legislative clashes, and demographic and partisan transformation. Researchers, students and those interested in Southern politics will find a page-turner worthy of a real-life mystery. How has the South changed so dramatically over the past 60 years yet remained so politically unique? The writers track down the answers like Sherlock Holmes and present the findings like V.O.

That honorific belongs to Alexander Wilson, whose encyclopedic <i>American Ornithology</i> established a distinctive approach that emphasized the observation of live birds. In the first full-length study to reproduce all of Wilson&#x2019;s unpublished drawings for the nine-volume <i>Ornithology,</i> Edward Burtt and William Davis illustrate Wilson&#x2019;s pioneering and, today, underappreciated achievement as the first ornithologist to describe the birds of the North American wilderness.</p><p><br></p><p><br>Abandoning early ambitions to become a poet in the mold of his countryman Robert Burns, Wilson emigrated from Scotland to settle near Philadelphia, where the botanist William Bartram encouraged his proclivity for art and natural history. Wilson traveled 12,000 miles on foot, on horseback, in a rowboat, and by stage and ship, establishing a network of observers along the way. He wrote hundreds of accounts of indigenous birds, discovered many new species, and sketched the behavior and ecology of each species he encountered.</p><p><br></p><p><br>Drawing on their expertise in both science and art, Burtt and Davis show how Wilson defied eighteenth-century conventions of biological illustration by striving for realistic depiction of birds in their native habitats. He drew them in poses meant to facilitate identification, making his work the model for modern field guides and an inspiration for Audubon, Spencer Fullerton Baird, and other naturalists who followed. On the bicentennial of his death, this beautifully illustrated volume is a fitting tribute to Alexander Wilson and his unique contributions to ornithology, ecology, and the study of animal behavior.</p></p><p>Edward H. Burtt, Jr. is Cincinnati Conference Professor of Zoology at Ohio Wesleyan University.A definitive work on the history of bird art, ornithology, and nature writing.

It's entirely right that we regularly remember to give Alexander Wilson the credit for inventing the school and ethos of American bird-study. (Steve Donoghue <i>Open Letters Monthly</i> 2013-04-01)<br><br>Before Audubon and <i>Birds of America</i>, there was Alexander Wilson and <i>American Ornithology</i>, a nine-volume work published between 1808 and 1814 that single-handedly transformed the study of birds in the wild and presaged the field guides of today. In addition to being the first to adopt the Linnaean system of binomial nomenclature to classify North American birds, Wilson was also one of the first to base his findings primarily on the 'observation and description of live birds.' By 1812, the Scottish poet had documented nearly 80% of bird species in the United States, and developed the discipline of 'economic ornithology,' whereby bird types are valued according to a kind of cost-benefit analysis (i.e. one that takes into account whether a bird is prone to destroy certain crops, whether they can be consumed, etc.)...What makes this book of such great value is the third chapter: 'Illustrating American Ornithology.' Composing over half of the book, this section features every illustration from Wilson's landmark publication. Alongside excerpts from Wilson's own commentary, the authors painstakingly detail how each sketch developed into its final iteration. A must-have for any serious bird-watcher." (<i>Publishers Weekly</i> 2013-03-11)<br><br>Wilson was first to describe 26 species of North American birds, he has more birds named after him than any other American ornithologist, and John James Audubon, Charles Lucien Bonaparte, Thomas Nuttall, Spencer Fullerton Baird, and Elliot Coues all were inspired by him, yet most people, when asked who the father of American ornithology is, say, wrongly, Audubon. This well-illustrated study, the first to reproduce many of Wilson's drawings and draft plates from <i>American Ornithology</i>, his nine-volume masterwork, sets the record straight. (Chuck Hagner and Matt Mendenhall <i>Bird Watching</i> 2013-06-01)<br><br>It is as the author of <i>American Ornithology--</i>a nine-volume work that aimed to list every species in the U.S.--that Wilson will be remembered. Wilson's books were revolutionary. He wrote his descriptions of birds from observing them in the field, rather than looking at stuffed birds in collections. It was an approach that helped promote the adoption of the scientific method in the U.S. He also penned his narrative so that readers would be able to identify birds themselves, making it the first field guide...Wilson's life and his struggle to publish <i>American Ornithology</i> are fascinating. (Peter Ranscombe <i>The Scotsman</i> 2013-06-08)<br><br><b>Burtt</b> and <b>Davis</b> argue convincingly for Wilson's contribution to modern scientific ornithology and celebrate Wilson as the man who inspired John James Audubon...This book...give[s] us Wilson's wonderful illustrations--and a sense of the spirit of an extraordinary man whose curiosity reached far beyond the man-made world. (Karin Altenberg <i>Wall Street Journal</i> 2013-06-21)<br><br>A Scottish emigr�, Alexander Wilson (1766-1813) became the preeminent ornithologist of early America. His systematic approach to the study of birds and his nine-volume <i>American Ornithology</i> (1808-14) greatly influenced John James Audubon, in whose shadow Wilson has since remained...<b>Burtt</b> and <b>Davis</b> describe Wilson's mentoring by such prominent figures as Thomas Jefferson, Meriwether Lewis, William Bartram, and the Philadelphia family of artists, the Peales...The authors show that it is Wilson, rather than Audubon, who deserves the sobriquet of the father of American ornithology...This excellent work is highly recommended for birders and for readers who appreciate American art or natural history.

In truth, the army spent only a small part of its frontier duty fighting Indians; as the main arm of the federal government in less-settled regions of the nation, the army performed a host of duties. <i>The Frontier Army in the Settlement of the West</i> examines the army&#x2019;s nonmartial contributions to western development. Dispelling timeworn stereotypes, Michael L. Tate shows that the army conducted explorations, compiled scientific and artistic records, built roads, aided overland travelers, and improved river transportation. Army posts offered nuclei for towns, and soldiers delivered federal mails, undertook agricultural experiments, and assembled weather records for forecasting.</p><p>The "multipurpose" army also provided telegraph service, extended relief to destitute civilians, and protected early national parks.</p></p><p><b>Michael L. Tate</b> is Professor of History Emeritus at the University of Nebraska, Omaha, and author of <i>The Frontier Army in the Settlement of the West </i>and<i> Indians and Emigrants: Encounters on the Overland Trail</i>.Tate, an established historian of the West, provides a valuable overview of the army's role in U.S. expansion beyond the Mississippi, a role that included much more than protecting whites from Indians. The army surveyed and explored, directly and as part of other expeditions, and provided extensive logistic support to westward movement before as well as after the Civil War. It was crucial in developing the national infrastructure of roads, railroads, river navigation, water supplies, and everything else on which civilization depends. Finally, officers and enlisted men alike frequently were also settlers, craftsmen, and entrepreneurs, both during and after their military service. Sometimes entrepreneurship was not disinterested; General Custer had investments in the mining companies that were trying to open the Lakotah territories in the Black Hills to settlement. The volume's frame of reference suggests that Tate intends it for a scholarly audience, but its admirable synthesis of existing research makes it vital to any serious student of the history of the American West. <i>Roland Green</i></p><h2>The Sacred Geometry Oracle: Book and Card Deck</h2><p>The cosmic patterns and universal truths of sacred geometry bridge past and future.

Her website is www.patricialeavy.com."This excellent, comprehensive work will be wonderful for classes and is also a good resource for researchers who want to explore different artistic approaches and their relationship to qualitative research. I plan to use it for both of these purposes. I highly recommend this book."--Carolyn S. Ellis, PhD, Department of Communication, University of South Florida <p>"The topic of this book is timely. Arts-based qualitative methods have grown and evolved rapidly over the last decade, and this book gives a very good overview of the most popular approaches. Most arts-based researchers have expertise in only one area and tend to write in that domain. An overview such as this one, with the added examples at the end of each chapter, is a useful contribution to the field."--Lynn Butler-Kisber, EdD, Director, Centre for Educational Leadership, McGill University, Canada </p>"Leavy effectively lays out the range of practices and potentialities for social scientists who are interested in adding arts-based approaches to their qualitative research practices. The book provides valuable jumping-off points for using innovative methods in the domains of narrative, poetry, music, performance, dance and movement, and visual arts. Instructors of qualitative methods courses across the social sciences would do well to add this resource to their libraries and course readings as a way of introducing senior undergraduate or entry-level graduate students to the invigorating possibilities made available when 'method meets art.' I would recommend the text for survey courses in qualitative methods and specialized courses in alternative or specifically arts-based approaches to research."--Monica Prendergast, PhD, Graduate School of Arts and Social Sciences, Division of Creative Arts and Learning, Lesley University<p>"This book seamlessly addresses fundamental questions about arts-based methods. It explores what arts-based methods are; their epistemological and theoretical foundations; the types of research questions for which they are suitable; how they are used to collect, analyze, interpret, and represent qualitative data; and how they can be evaluated. Leavy's engaging prose and examples convey the utility and beauty of arts-based methodologies."--Carol A. Bailey, PhD, Department of Sociology, Virginia Tech</p><p>"Leavy's wonderful book provides a substantive and outstanding introduction to arts-based approaches in qualitative inquiry. Chapters on each of the major art forms include an elegant overview of the modality; key text, journal, and online references for additional information; and representative contributions by some of the leading writers in qualitative research. <i>Method Meets Art</i> makes a significant and, most important, pragmatic contribution to the emerging literature in arts-based inquiry. This volume is not just for artists: Leavy provides <i>all</i> social researchers and students an excellent resource for exploring the aesthetic paradigm and an evocative genre of qualitative research."--Johnny Salda�a, MFA, School of Theatre and Film, Arizona State University </p><br><br>"An excellent introductory text for arts-based research (ABR). After nearly 90 years of debate about ABR and 35 years of controversy about its cousin, arts-based educational research (ABER), it is time for the arts as research to reside in the research methods classroom and in research proper....Leavy adeptly relates the most basic techniques in ABR&#x2014;giving them away to students and researchers alike. In addition, she exceeds the introduction of techniques by presenting excellent examples of ABR research by experienced ABR methodologists. These elucidate ABR methods by showing students and beginning researchers what those methods 'look like' when done well....Leavy's book is generally superb....I greatly appreciate Leavy's adept handling of this introduction to ABR, showing that it is legitimate, useful, and authentic among research methodologies. I have taught research methods in behavioral science for over 15 years and will use Leavy's book alongside a traditional research methods text, next time around. It is an excellent resource for students, for beginning researchers, and for academicians in the arts, literature, and social and behavioral sciences." (<i>PsycCRITIQUES</i> 2008-08-01)<br><br>"Her book is equally relevant to experienced researchers looking to synthesize their artistic and research interests, and students seeking to develop an understanding of innovative research practice. Of particular help for students is Leavy's succinct account of the positivist and paradigms, which she uses to contextualize arts-based research, and the 'Checklist of Considerations' and 'Discussion Questions and Activities' that feature in each chapter which ensure that the material, while academically challenging, is accessible to inexperienced researchers. Students and researchers alike will no doubt benefit from the extensive lists of suggested books, websites, and journals that accompany each chapter, and by creating individual chapters for narrative analysis, poetry, music, performance, dance and movement, and visual art, and by including within each chapter an exemplar of relevant published research, Leavy enables her readers to gain a sense of how a particular art form might suit their research needs and skills-set, while simultaneously validating each methodology and providing guidance over how specific research practice might be emulated." (<i>Qualitative Research</i> 2008-08-01)<br><br>"I found the book interesting and one I believe will be useful for those wanting to embark on using a different approach to research....The 'discussion questions and activities' included in each of the chapters will promote thought and help students clarify their hopes and expectations of their chosen research method. Likewise the 'suggested annotated reading' and 'web sites and journals' at the end of each chapter signpost the student to where they might further explore their research options....For those practising counselling and psychotherapy, whether engaged in therapy and/or research and not familiar with using alternative methods of enabling people to capture experience I believe this book could offer fresh insights to support and further their endeavours." (<i>Counselling and Psychotherapy Research</i> 2008-08-01)<br><br>"A breath of fresh air....The contribution of this book to the field of research method is invaluable not only because it is an oppositional effort to resist such a tendency of 'D�j� vu all over again,' but because there have not been any introductory books on arts-based research that we could recommend to graduate students who are interested in arts-based research....Leavy successfully establishes the legitimacy of arts-based research in social science research and succinctly explains how pivotal arts-based research is to the future of academic research. Leavy invites the reader to imagine a world of arts-based research alongside her, keeping the tone of a novel narrator rather than that of an epic narrator, encouraging the reader to an open dialogue rather than being conclusive and closed. In order to serve as an introductory book, Leavy offers readers reader-friendly, step-by-step description of six different genres of arts-based research: narrative inquiry, poetry, music, performance, dance, and visual art." (<i>International Journal of Education and the Arts</i> 2008-08-01)<br><br>"Maybe [the] strange divide between art and science in research and especially qualitative research will begin to erode away as more readers find Patricia Leavy's new 2009 tome, Method Meets Art: Arts-Based Research Practice, and begin to realize that researchers conducting narrative, poetic, musical, performative, dance, and visual forms of inquiry employ rigorous methods of data collection, analysis, interpretation, and representation too. Consumers of Leavy's book should also find a comfortable introduction to these arts-based approaches and hopefully an invitation to try some of these methodological modes in research of their own. In her well-written and engaging work, Leavy carefully introduces the world of arts-based research by walking us through the paradigmatic contexts that have helped to shape this approach to inquiry as well as to establish the conflicting perspectives that hinder many to see these methods as being research at all. She also recounts the struggles with monolithic standards of quality in qualitative research and calls for a dialogue to continue regarding the aesthetics and pragmatics of research. By engaging in such conversation Leavy suggests we all could benefit from challenging our own comfort zones and begin to see that we can all learn from our colleagues regardless of the method being utilized....In reading Leavy's book I can now see that all forms of research can inform, perform, reform, and transform what we think we know about the world around as well as ourselves as researchers and readers."

Ryrie, the book of Revelation was not designed to confuse or mystify its readers, but to enlighten them about future events.Revelation, the only major prophetic book in the New Testament, was written by the apostle John while in exile on the island of Patmos. John was commanded by God not to seal the book (22:10), and those who read it are promised a special blessing (1:3). Apparently, therefore, the book was expected to be intelligible and helpful to those who read it.This refreshing, concise new edition, with its helpful charts and graphs, is written especially for those who want to understand what lies ahead in God&#39;s plan.Dr. Ryrie&#39;s careful attention to detail and understandable explanations will not only help to clear some of the mystery surrounding the book of Revelation, but heighten your confidence that God&#39;s victory over Satan, death, and sin is only a matter of time.&#39;Blessed is the one who reads the words of this prophecy, and blessed are those who hear it and take to heart what is written in it, because the time is near.&#39;~ Revelation 1:3 NIV</p><p>This refreshing, concise new edition, with helpful charts and graphs, is written especially for those who want to understand what lies ahead in God&#39;s plan. The more one learns about that plan, the grater the confidence that God&#39;s victory over Satan, death, and sin is only a matter of time.<b>CHARLES C.

Mr Verloc, employed by a foreign embassy to incriminate an anarchist group, instead destroys his family, his illusions, and his own life, in a terrorist act gone utterly wrong. Conrad&#39;s ironic and troubling novel exposes the futility of political extremism and the strength,and vanity of human illusion.</p><p>The Secret Agent (1907) is a compelling tale of espionage and terrorism set in Edwardian London.

It presents the results of the Parallel Distributed Processing (PDP) group&#39;s work in the early 1980s and provides a good overview of the earlier neural network research. The PDP approach (also known as connectionism among other things) is based on the conviction that various aspects of cognitive activity are thought of in terms of massively parallel processing. The first volume starts with the general framework and continues with an analysis of learning mechanisms and various mathematical and computational tools important in the analysis of neural networks. The chapter on backpropagation is written by Rumelhart, Hinton, and Williams, who codiscovered the algorithm in 1986. The second volume is written with a psychological and biological emphasis. It explores the relationship of PDP to various aspects of human cognition. The book is a comprehensive research survey of its time and most of the book&#39;s results and methods are still at the foundation of the neural network field.This book describes the authors work in developing a theoretical framework for describing parallel distributed processing activity and in applying the framework to the development of models of aspects of perception, memory, language, and thought.</p><h2>Klein Dytham Architecture: Frame Monographs of Contemporary Interior Architects</h2><p>British architects Mark Dytham and Astrid Klein arrived in Japan in 1988.

Taking the achievements, ambiguities, and legacies of world War II as a point of departure, the book reveals the strains on the Soviet system in the postwar decades as it distanced itself from Stalinist repression and reinvented itself as a form of illiberal modern welfare state. The author shows how tens of millions of people moved from villages to cities to reap the benefits of modern civilization, while Soviet society remained divided along class, regional, and ethnic lines &#x2013; divisions that came into sharp focus with the collapse of the Soviet Union.

And the Christian life is likewise rooted in the cross. The studies in this guide, written by John Stott and based on his book <em>The Cross of Christ</em>, are designed to bring us to the heart of the cross with an understanding of what was accomplished there on our behalf. We begin with an individual perspective but move on from there into a deeper understanding of what it means to live as a community under the cross. Our worship, our call to mission, our ability to love our enemies and to face the perplexities of suffering--the cross transforms everything! These studies provide the ever-increasing understanding of the cross needed by every believer.</p><p>Our most popular line of Bible study guides provides solid biblical content and raises thought-provoking issues for individual or group benefit. Choose from studies on Old and New Testament books, character studies, topical studies--or take advantage of our helpful titles for small groups and group leaders. <p>This is a growing series and not yet complete. More volumes are forthcoming.</p>John R. W. Stott (1921-2011) has been known worldwide as a preacher, evangelist and communicator of Scripture. For many years he served as rector of All Souls Church in London, where he carried out an effective urban pastoral ministry. A leader among evangelicals in Britain, the United States and around the world, Stott was a principal framer of the landmark Lausanne Covenant (1974). His many books have sold millions of copies around the world and in dozens of languages. Stott's best-known work, <em>Basic Christianity,</em> has sold two million copies and has been translated into more than 60 languages. Other titles include <em>The Cross of Christ, Understanding the Bible, The Contemporary Christian, Evangelical Truth, Issues Facing Christians Today, The Incomparable Christ, Why I Am a Christian</em> and <em>Through the Bible Through the Year,</em> a daily devotional. He has also written eight volumes in <em>The Bible Speaks Today</em> series of New Testament expositions. Whether in the West or in the Two-Thirds World, a hallmark of Stott's ministry has been expository preaching that addresses the hearts and minds of contemporary men and women. Stott was honored by <em>Time</em> magazine in 2005 as one of the "100 Most Influential People in the World" and was named in the Queen?s New Years Honours list as Commander of the Order of the British Empire. In 1969, Stott founded the Langham Trust to fund scholarships for young evangelical leaders from the Majority World. He then founded the Evangelical Literature Trust, which provided books for students, pastors and theological libraries in the Majority World. These two trusts continued as independent charities until 2001, when they were joined as a single charity: the Langham Partnership. Langham's vision continues today to see churches in the Majority World equipped for mission and growing to maturity in Christ through nurturing national movements for biblical preaching, fostering the creation and distribution of evangelical literature, and enhancing evangelical theological education.</p><h2>The Golden Bowl (Penguin Modern Classics)</h2><p>&#39;This story of the alliance between Italian aristocracy and American millionaires is &#34;a work unique among all [James&#39;] novels: it is [his] only novel in which things come out right for his characters ...he had finally resolved the questions, curious and passionate, that had kept him at his desk on his inquiries into the process of living.

With clarity and expertise, Joseph Cirincione presents an even-handed look at the history of nuclear proliferation and an optimistic vision of its future, providing a comprehensive survey of the wide range of critical perspectives.<br><br>Cirincione begins with the first atomic discoveries of the 1930s and covers the history of their growth all the way to current crisis with Iran. He unravels the science, strategy, and politics that have fueled the development of nuclear stockpiles and increased the chance of a nuclear terrorist attack. He also explains why many nations choose not to pursue nuclear weapons and pulls from this the outlines of a solution to the world's proliferation problem: a balance of force and diplomacy, enforcement and engagement that yields a steady decrease in these deadly arsenals. <br><br>Though nuclear weapons have not been used in war since August 1945, there is no guarantee this good fortune will continue. A unique blend of history, theory, and security analysis, <i>Bomb Scare</i> is an engaging text that not only supplies the general reader and student with a clear understanding of this issue but also provides a set of tools policymakers and scholars can use to prevent the cataclysmic consequences of another nuclear attack.</p><p>Beginning with the atomic discoveries of the 1930s, Joseph Cirincione unravels the science, strategy, and politics that have fueled the development of nuclear stockpiles and increased the chance of a nuclear terrorist attack.

Rich in detail, his obsessively worked drawings pull freely from myriad sources spanning the cultural spectrum. The resulting, highly poetic constructions function as acute reflections of contemporary society. Throughout the years, his subjects have included political figures and historical events, with particular intensity since the events of September 11, 2001. Seen here are images of Ronald and Nancy Reagan, J. Edgar Hoover, both Bush presidents, the Kennedys, Hitler, scenes from the Vietnam War and protest movements, wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, the prisoner abuse of Abu Ghraib, President Obama and Osama bin Laden. <b>Raymond Pettibon</b> (born 1957) studied economics at UCLA around the same time he joined his brother in the punk band Black Flag. He soon began to contribute artwork to album covers, flyers and t-shirts, for the band and its label, SST Records, and exhibited his work in group shows in galleries in the 1980s. Since the 1990s his work has been the subject of numerous major solo exhibitions.</p><p>RAYMOND PETTIBON: HERE'S YOUR IRONY BACK, POLITICAL WORKS 1975-2013 is superior in its design and reproduction, on uncoated paper stock appropriate to the art, but is also unavoidably reductive. A glance at the dates of Pettibon's notionally topical drawings shows that his targets are often long past their sell-by dates as subjects for satire-like his early-'80s works sending up hippies and Vietnam protesters. He has a larger goal: to create a commedia dell'America whose stock characters, such as the Artist (Krazy Kat), the Politician (Reagan), the Movie Queen (Joan Crawford), and the Villain (Manson), pitilessly reflects the broken culture that produced them.

Changes in the fundamental sources of energy, and in the use of energy sources, are a basic dimension of the evolution of society. Our appreciation of the significance of these processes is essential to a fuller understanding of world history.Vaclav Smil offers a comprehensive look at the role of energy in world history, ranging from human muscle-power in foraging societies and animal-power in traditional farming to preindustrial hydraulic techniques and modern fossil-fueled civilization. The book combines a vast historical sweep with cross-cultural comparisons and is enhanced by illustrations and accessible quantitative material. Students and general readers alike will gain an understanding of energy's fundamental role in human progress.Smil illuminates the role played by various means of harnessing energy in different societies and provides new insights by explaining the impact and limitations of these fundamental physical inputs&#x2014;whether it is in the cultivation of crops, smelting of metals, waging of war, or the mass production of goods. While examining the energetic foundations of historical changes, <i>Energy in World History</i> avoids simplistic, deterministic views of energy needs and recognizes the complex interplay of physical and social realities.</p><p><b>Vaclav Smil</b> teaches at the University of Manitoba. He has written thirteen books, including <i>Energy, Food, Environment: Realities, Myths, Options; General Energetics;</i> and <i>Global Ecology, Environmental Change, and Social Flexibility.</i>Essays for college-level readers examine various aspects of the role of energy in world events; from human and animal-powered early tools to the evolution of fossil-fueled civilization. Especially intriguing are the cross-cultural comparisons and details on fuel development and changes in world energy pattern usage. -- <i>Midwest Book Review</i></p><h2>Lost Islamic History: Reclaiming Muslim Civilisation from the Past</h2><p>Islam has been one of the most powerful religious, social and political forces in history. Over the last 1400 years, from origins in Arabia, a succession of Muslim polities and later empires expanded to control territories and peoples that ultimately stretched from southern France to East Africa and South East Asia.<br>Yet many of the contributions of Muslim thinkers, scientists and theologians, not to mention rulers, statesmen and soldiers, have been occluded. This book rescues from oblivion and neglect some of these personalities and institutions while offering the reader a new narrative of this lost Islamic history. The Umayyads, Abbasids, and Ottomans feature in the story, as do Muslim Spain, the savannah kingdoms of West Africa and the Mughal Empire, along with the later European colonization of Muslim lands and the development of modern nation-states in the Muslim world. Throughout, the impact of Islamic belief on scientific advancement, social structures, and cultural development is given due prominence, and the text is complemented by portraits of key personalities, inventions and little known historical nuggets. The history of Islam and of the world's Muslims brings together diverse peoples, geographies and states, all interwoven into one narrative that begins with Muhammad and continues to this day.<br></p><p><br>Firas Alkhateeb is an American researcher, writer and historian who specialises in the Islamic world.

The book begins with an in-depth look at the earliest years in Colombia's history, emphasizing the role geography played in shaping Colombia's economy, society, and politics and in encouraging the growth of distinctive regional cultures and identities. It includes a thorough discussion of Colombian politics that looks at the ways in which historical memory has affected political choices, particularly in the formation and development of the country's two traditional political parties. The authors explore the factors that have contributed to Colombia's economic troubles, such as the delay in its national economic integration and its relative ineffectiveness as an exporter. The three concluding chapters offer an authoritative and up-to-date examination of the impact of coffee on Colombia's economy and society, the social and political effects of urban growth, and the multiple dimensions of the violence that has plagued the country since 1946. Written in clear, vigorous prose, <em>Colombia: Fragmented Land, Divided Society</em> is essential for students of Latin American history and politics, and for anyone interested in gaining a deeper understanding of the history of this fascinating and tumultuous country.<br></p><p>Frank Safford is at Northwestern University.

The book begins with the basic markup concepts and single unit, three variable spreadsheets and builds the information to complex assortment plans and multi-column/multi-row spreadsheets. <b> </b> The authors provide an introduction to merchandising with an emphasis on retail pricing and profit and loss statements, as well as planning strategy, sales and stock, fashion forecasting, assortment planning, unit control and buying and selling concerns. <b> </b> For individuals involved in the merchandising of fashion goods. </p></p><p><p> This text provides a comprehensive introduction to the financial management of merchandising fashion goods. Merchandising concepts and math skills required to make good financial decisions are presented in an integrated framework so that students see how merchandising theory and mathematical formulas are applied to solve real-world retailing problems. To be successful in our fast moving retail environment, students must know more than pre-set formulas and store specific formats. They must under stand the merchandising principles and the managerial decision-making processes that underpin good decision-making. This text integrates the presentation of merchandising and retailing concepts, managerial planning and decision-making processes, and mathematical formulas used in retail operations. Students learn both the merchandising knowledge and mathematical skills needed to succeed in the field of merchandising. </p> <b>Key Features</b> <ul> <li>Integrated presentation of merchandising principles, mathematical formulas, and real world applications</li> <li>Comprehensive coverage of financial skills required for successfully planning, procuring, and selling fashion goods</li> <li>Strong coverage of the managerial planning process (Introduced in Chapter 5, and integrated in Chapters 6, 7, 8, and 9)</li> <li>Relationships between variables in a formula are explained prior to presenting the calculation of a formula</li> <li>Spreadsheet applications are provided for each concept</li> <li>Study Wizard CD-ROM included with the text, provides the student with a wealth of additional problems and practice quiz questions</li> </ul><p> This book is written for students who seek to be successful in retail, merchandising, and marketing, and who want to know the subject matter in more depth than what is necessary to simply find the solution to a problem. Such knowledge is the foundation to making good decisions, critical to the success of any business, and in turn, critical to the success of future careers. Possessing a solid understanding of merchandising math, making decisions based on sound principles backed with numeric explanation, and explaining decision processes to colleagues and bosses will be important every day in future merchandising careers. Companies can be saved or destroyed by the financial decisions made and the impact of those decisions on merchandising outcomes, especially those of product assortment and customer satisfaction. In this book, students are introduced to a broader knowledge about merchandising math and its application in day-to-day business transactions. With this knowledge, they will possess the aptitude to become skilled in and make decisions based on a variety of specialized programs. </p> <p> In the past, many teachers, ourselves included, have used multiple books, drawn upon personal work experiences, created reams of worksheets, and designed hundreds of overheads and handouts to teach merchandising math. We were always searching for the book that would provide the right combination of background information, basic management decisions, mathematical formulas, explanation, and practice. From alumni, advisory boards and our own work experiences, we knew that few people in merchandising work in isolation; most work within organizations that expect teamwork and cross-functional networking. Even fewer people work with only numbers, and most work with problems, situations, and outcomes. To provide students with this integrated understanding, only this one book is needed&#x2014;no more multiple book purchases, no more copies from the copy machine, no more extra exercises. </p> <p> Formulas without explanations are merely mathematics; and management, marketing and merchandising processes without financial justification are merely theories. The two sides of the coin must merge for the student. With an understanding and a working knowledge of the formulas and their conceptual basis, the student will be able to work within any retail type, with any product classification, and for any size of business. When students memorize the formulas without understanding their application in a real-world work environment, they lack the ability to apply the information to new situations, to new products, or to new formats. With the approach that is provided in this book, students will understand why, how, and when to use this merchandising math information. They can work for a major chain that has its own hybrid computer system, a small, local store, or in any business in between and still understand the factors that must be considered in the financial decisions for the business. </p> <p> This book is organized into four parts. The first part provides an overview of merchandising and retailing, with the basic spreadsheet format and pricing formulas used throughout the book. The next three parts follow the three-stage process of merchandising: planning, buying, and selling. To assist in the learning process, a student's solutions manual and a CD with test questions are available. For faculty, we provide a teaching manual including full solutions for all problems and transparency masters for several of the figures within the textbook. </p> <p> In Part 1, "Introduction and Basics," Chapter 1 begins the study with the merchandising function within retail. This information is important for students who must understand the interrelated activities within retail and the importance of the team concept in merchandising. This foundation assists students, in later chapters, to perceive the impact of managerial decisions made in the merchandising function on the activities of other retail functions, such as operations, sales, and promotions. Chapter 2 presents the information on unit pricing and the elements of price. The student is introduced to the spreadsheet format of financial planning and the relationships between the basic elements of retail price, markup, and cost. Chapter 3 expands the basic price elements from one product unit to the store or business level. Chapter 4 expands a simple Profit and Loss statement into a complex statement that includes discussions of reductions, margins, and operations. This chapter also includes information about alterations, requirements of sales associates to wear company clothing, and other unique aspects of financial planning in the fashion industry. </p> <p> Part 2, "Planning," begins with the broad scope of strategic planning. The basic process of strategic planning is described in Chapter 5, including the relationships of the P&amp;L statement to the planning process and the role of the merchandising function in planning. The concepts in Chapter 5 are used extensively in subsequent chapters on planning sales, stock, and forecasting. Additionally, the value of an environmental scan and the collection of information, as described in Chapter 5, become evident to students through concepts and practice. Chapter 6 provides a unique view of sales planning from the perspective of both a continuing business and a new business. Chapter 6 also examines the various methods of planning stock, including discussions of turn, average stock, and the problems with fashion-oriented stock. Chapter 7 reveals the importance of stock to the merchandising process and the methods of determining appropriate stock levels. The presentation in Chapter 8 encourages students to compile the knowledge that they have acquired into developing the six-month spreadsheet. (Using this book, our students find that the six-month plan is easy to master. With texts we used previously, they struggled to assimilate a great deal of seemingly unrelated information.) </p> <p> Part 3, "Buying," contains 'specific information and processes about the buying function within merchandising. For many students, these are their favorite chapters because we talk about the "real world" of buying: low buyers forecast (Chapter 9), how buyers organize the forecasting information (Chapter 10), what buyers do when they go to market (Chapter 12), and the specific number functions that are involved with determining open-to-buy and terms of the sale (Chapters 11 and 13). In this section, we provide exercises for the students to practice their forecasting skills and plan market trips. The chapter on assortment planning (Chapter 10) contains extensive and unique information not available in other merchandising texts about the organizational process of planning for buying. The merchandise classification system taught in this section enables the student as a future buyer to computerize the buying plan and prepare new buys to be entered into the computerized inventory systems used by most retail businesses. The balance, between the qualitative forecasting in Chapter 9 and the quantitative forecasting in Chapters 10 and 11, helps the student to understand the multiple-task role of the corporate and individual buyer. </p> <p> Part 4, "Selling," completes the merchandising process. This part examines the floor functions of the buyer, and helps students bring closure to the class to understand more fully the interrelated functionality of merchandising and retailing. Buyers, merchandisers, department and store managers, and promotions personnel must work as a team to deliver the product to the consumer at the right price and the right time. Buying functions are closely related to inventory (Chapter 14), price adjustments including markdowns and other price adjustments (Chapter 15), and promotions, sales associates, and other methods of marketing communications between the retailer and the customer (Chapter 16). The information on price adjustments, especially markdowns, is presented in the context of the spreadsheet formats used for pricing as taught in Chapter 2. The student uses this chapter as a refresher on the information in Chapter 2 and is able to integrate the information from many concepts throughout the book into the managerial decisions used to make price adjustment decisions. The final chapter on marketing communications (Chapter 16) introduces the concepts of the various aspects of marketing communications, including promotions, sales, and public relations. The importance of these topics to the merchandising function is emphasized. This provides the student with an introduction, but not overlap, to this information for their subsequent courses in a retailing, business, or merchandising program. </p> <p> We developed this book based on our combined experiences of teaching merchandising math, working as a buyer for a major retail corporation and a small privately owned apparel store, owning our own businesses, and working in both the fabric and apparel manufacturing segments of the fashion industry. We know firsthand the importance of financial decision making in the success of both small retail businesses and large multi-chain corporations. Dons Kincade was the owner of a family-owned and managed retail chain of dry cleaners/launderettes for ten years, worked for two years at Cone Mills, interned with Russell Corporation, and has been a Faculty Fellow with the Textile and Technology Corporation TC2 since 1990. Fay Gibson was a buyer and then divisional merchandise manager for a partner group of Belk Stores for fifteen years, was the fashion director and trainer for a store group for Belk Stores, and was the owner/buyer of a ladies specialty store for seven years. We have been in the "real world" and have used what we know from that world to provide students with what they need to survive and thrive in business. </p> <p> In addition, this book is the culmination of years of teaching at small schools, large universities, and major industrial corporations. Doris Kincade has taught merchandising math at Auburn University and Virginia Tech for more than twelve years, and taught merchandising courses prior to that for fourteen years at Peace College. Fay Gibson taught merchandising math and other merchandising courses for ten years at The University of North Carolina at Greensboro and has been a consultant or provided training for several Fortune 500 companies, Apparel Marts, and specialty retailers. Ginger Woodard has taught merchandising math and other merchandising courses at East Carolina for ten years, taught merchandising courses at Peace College for an additional seven years, and provided leadership for groundbreaking curriculum development for her area at East Carolina University. </p> <p> Over the years, we have taught thousands of college students and hundreds of industry personnel. We have designed this book to help students think, to assist them with learning and practicing formulas, and to aid them in building merchandising knowledge as well as mathematical skills&#x2014;a combination needed to succeed in business. We were inspired in writing this book by the thousands of students who asked questions in class, stayed after class for extra help, and either struggled with or loved merchandising math. Our combined years of teaching experience represent over 3,000 students who sat in our classrooms and listened to us teach merchandising math. With every semester of teaching&#x2014;and for the three of us that represents about 85 semesters of merchandising math&#x2014;we have refined the ideas in this book, developed exercises that assist with skill development, and organized the concepts to improve student learning. </p></p><h2>The Lotus Transcendent: Indian and Southeast Asian Art from the Samuel Eilenberg Collection</h2><p>Lotus Transcendent, The</p><p></p><h2>Cultural Contexts for Ralph Ellison&#39;s Invisible Man: A Bedford Documentary Companion</h2><p>A unique supplement to one of the most important African American novels of this century.

Using Muncie, Indiana - the Lynds' now iconic Middletown - as a touchstone, David Nye explores how electricity seeped into and redefined American culture. With an eye for telling details from archival sources and a broad understanding of cultural and social history, he creates a thought-provoking panorama of a technology fundamental to modern life.<br> <br> Emphasizing the experiences of ordinary men and women rather than the lives of inventors and entrepreneurs, Nye treats electrification as a set of technical possibilities that were selectively adopted to create the streetcar suburb, the amusement park, the "Great White Way," the assembly line, the electrified home, and the industrialized farm. He shows how electricity touched every part of American life, how it became an extension of political ideologies, how it virtually created the image of the modern city, and how it even pervaded colloquial speech, confirming the values of high energy and speed that have become hallmarks of the twentieth century. He also pursues the social meaning of electrification as expressed in utopian ideas and exhibits at world's fairs, and explores the evocation of electrical landscapes in painting, literature, and photography.<br> <br> <i>Electrifying America </i>combines chronology and topicality to examine the major forms of light and power as they came into general use. It shows that in the city electrification promoted a more varied landscape and made possible new art forms and new consumption environments. In the factory, electricity permitted a complete redesign of the size and scale of operations, shifting power away from the shop floor to managers. Electrical appliances redefined domestic work and transformed the landscape of the home, while on the farm electricity laid the foundation for today's agribusiness.</p><p>David E. Nye is Professor of American History at the University of Southern Denmark. The winner of the 2005 Leonardo da Vinci Medal of the Society for the History of Technology, he is the author of <i>Image Worlds: Corporate Identities at General Electric, 1890-1930</i> (1985), <i>Electrifying America: Social Meanings of a New Technology, 1880-1940</i> (1990), <i>American Technological Sublime</i> (1994), <i>Consuming Power: A Social History of American Energies</i> (1997), <i>America as Second Creation: Technology and Narratives of New Beginnings</i> (2003), and <i>Technology Matters: Questions to Live With</i> (2006), all published by the MIT Press.<br> <br> David Nye casts his bright light on everything from assembly lines to washing machines, from the plummeting price of urban electricity to the usefulness of electric incubators in chicken farming... Mr. Nye succeeds not simply because he knows his technology, but also because be understands the complexity of American culture.... [He] has the breadth of knowledge and the good sense to see the significance in paintings like Edward Hopper's 'Nighthawks'... and to weave such observations into the very armature of his argument that electricity transformed not only American life but the American self " &#x2014;<b>John R.

Paul Getty Museum</h2><p>New York in the mid-1950s was a time of detectives, G-men, mobsters, and crime photographers. Weegee (American. b. Austria, 1899-1968) fit this last profile perfectly. Speed Graphic camera in hand, he dashed around the city responding to the police radio, recording accidents, arrests, fires, and murders. This volume in the J. Paul Getty Museum's In Focus series examines approximately fifty of the ninty-five Weegee prints in the collection, surveying his photojournalism as well as additional works that picture life in the Bowery, Greenwich Village, and Harlem. Judith Keller, Associate Curator in the Department of Photographs, provides an introduction to Weegee and commentary on the plates.<br>The photographer was the subject of a colloquium at the Getty Museum on August 27, 2004, where the author was joined by David Featherstone, Michael Hargraves, Weston Naef, Miles Orvell, Ira Richer, Colin Westerbeck, and Cynthia Young in discussing his life and work. This conversation, captured here in an edited transcript, traces Weegee's transition from crime photography to social documentarian, with special attention paid to his publications, including Naked City (1945). William McCleery, in the foreword to that book, calls Weegee "an Artist" with "his own conception of what constitutes beauty." With the issuance of this In Focus installment, readers can again share in Weegee's conception.</p><p>Judith Keller is associate curator of photographs at the Getty Museum.</p><h2>Collected Short Stories: Volume 4 (Penguin Twentieth Century Classics)</h2><p>This final classic collection reveals Somerset Maugham&#x2019;s unique talent for exposing and exploring the bitter realities of human relationships in tales of love, infidelity, passion and prejudice.

Somerset Maugham</b>&nbsp;(1874-1965) lived in Paris until he was ten. He was educated at King's School, Canterbury, and at Heidelberg University. He afterwards walked the wards of St. Thomas's Hospital with a view to practice in medicine, but the success of his first novel,&nbsp;<b>Liza of Lambeth</b>&nbsp;(1897), won him over to letters. Something of his hospital experience is reflected, however, in the first of his masterpieces,&nbsp;<b>Of Human Bondage</b>&nbsp;(1915), and with&nbsp;<b>The Moon and Sixpence</b>&nbsp;(1919) his reputation as a novelist was assured.<br><br>His position as one of the most successful playwrights on the London stage was being consolidated simultaneously. His first play,&nbsp;<b>A Man of Honour</b>&nbsp;(1903), was followed by a procession of successes just before and after the First World War. (At one point only Bernard Shaw had more plays running at the same time in London.) His theatre career ended with&nbsp;<b>Sheppey</b>&nbsp;(1933).&nbsp;His fame as a short-story writer began with&nbsp;<b>The Trembling of a Leaf</b>, sub-titled&nbsp;<b>Little Stories of the South Sea Islands</b>, in 1921, after which he published more than ten collections.<br><br>W. Somerset Maugham's general books are fewer in number. They include travel books, such as&nbsp;<b>On a Chinese Screen</b>&nbsp;(1922) and&nbsp;<b>Don Fernando</b>&nbsp;(1935), essays, criticism, and the self-revealing&nbsp;<b>The Summing Up</b>&nbsp;(1938) and&nbsp;<b>A Writer's Notebook</b>&nbsp;(1949).&nbsp;He became a Companion of Honour in 1954. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>&#34;The short story was Maugham&#39;s true metier, and some of the stories he wrote are among the best in the language&#34; -- Anthony Burgess &#34;One of my favourite writers&#34; -- Gabriel Garcia Marquez</p><h2>Plant Names in Yiddish: a Handbook of Botanical Terminology</h2><p>Alexander Harkavy (1863&#x2013;1939) is credited with almost single-handedly creating an intellectual environment conducive to Yiddish, and his trilingual dictionary is an indispensable tool for research in Yiddish language and literature.

Published before its author was twenty-four, to instantaneous nationwide acclaim, it was an event in literary history. Immediately followed by dozens of imitations, Goethe's first play inaugurated a new era of dramatic art. Besides its warmth and joy and vigor, this play has a special importance. It launched a great literary career; it revived a tradition in abeyance since Marlowe and Shakespeare, the tradition of drama based on the history of one's own country, rather than on Greek and Roman subjects. It pronounced "Open Sesame!" before the door of European Romanticism--setting the course for Schiller's more ambitious dramas, inspiring Walter Scott's historical romances, and joining with other influences to stir into life the dramas and tales of Victor Hugo and Alexandre Dumas. <i>Gotz von Berlichingen,</i> in short, was the point of origin for patriotic and nostalgic period pieces in many languages. To read it today is to immerse oneself in a play by youth for youth and for the young at heart, and to relive a stirring moment in the history of world literature.<p> Titles of related interest from Waveland Press: Hauptmann, <i>Three Plays [The Weavers, Hannele, and The Beaver Coat]</i> (ISBN 9780881335408); Novalis, <i>Henry von Ofterdingen: A Novel</i> (ISBN 9780881335743); and Plenzdorf, <i>The New Sufferings of Young W.</i> (ISBN 9780881338911).</p></p><p></p><h2>Microsoft Visual C# Step by Step</h2><p><b>Your hands-on guide to Microsoft Visual C# fundamentals with Visual Studio 2015</b> <br>Expand your expertise--and teach yourself the fundamentals of programming with the latest version of Visual C# with Visual Studio 2015.

These are events that stir the political imagination; but, as Streitmatter shows, they also demonstrate how American journalism, since the 1760s, has not merely recorded this nation's history but has played a role in <i>shaping</i> it. This book is the first of its kind. Streitmatter avoids the mind-numbing lists of names, dates, and newspaper headlines that bog down the standard journalism history textbook. Instead, he focuses on a limited number of episodes, identifying common characteristics within the news media. The third edition includes an entirely new chapter on social media and the election of Barack Obama. This edition also looks beyond traditional journalistic outlets such as newspapers and television news reports to examine the modern-day role that the Internet and its various venues play in reporting the news and shaping history.</p><p><b>Rodger Streitmatter</b> is professor of journalism at American University. A journalist and historian, he is the author of several books and has contributed to numerous popular and scholarly periodicals, including <i>The Washington Post, The Advocate, Journalism and Mass Communication Quarterly,</i> and <i>American Journalism.</i><b>Praise for the Third Edition of Rodger Streitmatter's <i>Mightier than the Sword</i></b><br><br> When it comes to looking American journalism square in the eye and asking exactly the right questions, no book offers a fresher perspective and does it better than <i>Mightier Than the Sword</i>. Just for his examination alone of the media's failure over the years to support women's suffrage, or for questioning what is ethical in the pursuit of a cause as important as independence, Rodger Streitmatter deserves high grades for making his readers critically rethink their preconceived notions.&#x201d;<br> <b>Steve Klein, coordinator of the Journalism program at George Mason University</b><br><br>"Streitmatter's book is an excellent auxiliary text for an introductory mass media class. It provides students with a real sense of the role the media have played in the development of American society and how they were used as agents of social change. It also provides a context for the role the media play today."<br> <b>Dave Cassady, Pacific University</b><br><br><br><br> Rodger Streitmatter's <i>Mightier than the Sword</i> is a welcome addition to my course in the history of American mass media. His writing style is accessible and enjoyable for students, and his focus on important historical moments makes it easy for me to make good use of the text no matter how I organize my class. Students like this book because it's fun to read, and I like it because it asks them to think critically about something important the role of journalism in shaping American history.&#x201d;<br> <b>Janice Hume, Grady College of Journalism and Mass Communication, University of Georgia</b><br><br> Many students tell me in their course evaluations that <i>Mightier Than the Sword</i> is one of their favorite textbooks ever. It's so interestingly written that some of them don't even wait until the end of the semester to tell me how inspiring it is and that it's one textbook they plan to keep. This has been the case since I started using it back with the first edition. Pretty good for a book on history, a subject many students don't expect to enjoy. Doubly good that the book has always been more affordably priced than most texts students are asked to buy.&#x201d;<br> <b>James Pinson, Eastern Michigan University</b><br><br><b>Praise for Previous Editions:</b><br><br> In this engagingly written collection of case studies, Rodger Streitmatter demonstrates that journalism history is much more than a static gallery of the usual portraits...Overall, the second edition of <i>Mightier than the Sword </i>is well worth acquiring, as it offers substantial new content and updates. As in the first edition, Streitmatter writes gracefully and concisely, in a style sure to command students' interest. He embeds considerable scholarship in each chapter, so that readers wishing more can easily see where next to go This book will continue to be useful not only in the standard journalism history course but in myriad others from media and society to media criticism to reporting.&#x201d;<br> <b><i>Journalism History</i> (Nancy L. Roberts, SUNY-Albany) </b><br><br> In succinct, engrossing prose, Streitmatter shows how courageous, effective communicators have accepted their own and their media's limitations to shape the outcome of events from abolitionism to anti-Semitism, women's rights to civil rights, the Ku Klux Klan to Vietnam.&#x201d;<br> <b><i>Booklist</i></b><br><br> An easy-to-digest overview of the media's influence on American history and politics A fine introductory textbook for a journalism class.&#x201d;<br> <b><i>Kirkus Reviews</i></b></p><h2>The Everything Songwriting Book: All You Need to Create and Market Hit Songs</h2><p><b>Simple techniques for creating catchy lyrics and memorable melodies!</b><br><br>Nearly everyone can hum the melody or remember the words to a hit song.

From the elegant, such as Audrey Hepburn's simple black shift or Princess Di's never-ending wedding gown, to the quirky, such as Bjork's Swan Dress or the Liz Hurley safety-pin dress, to the simply unforgettable - such as Marilyn's famous moment in white in The Seven Year Itch or Madonna's perilous-looking conical bustierre. <br><br>Megan Hess has spent her career exploring and illustrating fashion.

Freud invented a psychological treatment that involved the telling and revising of life stories, but he was himself skeptical of the writing of such stories. In this biography, Adam Phillips, whom the <i>New Yorker </i>calls &#x201c;Britain&#x2019;s foremost psychoanalytical writer,&#x201d; emphasizes the largely and inevitably undocumented story of Freud&#x2019;s earliest years as the oldest&#x2014;and favored&#x2014;son of Jewish immigrants from Eastern Europe and suggests that the psychoanalysis Freud invented was, among many other things, a psychology of the immigrant&#x2014;increasingly, of course, everybody&#x2019;s status in the modern world.<br> &nbsp;<br> Psychoanalysis was also Freud&#x2019;s way of coming to terms with the fate of the Jews in Europe in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. So as well as incorporating the writings of Freud and his contemporaries, <i>Becoming Freud</i> also uses the work of historians of the Jews in Europe in this significant period in their lives, a period of unprecedented political freedom and mounting persecution. Phillips concludes by speculating what psychoanalysis might have become if Freud had died in 1906, before the emergence of a psychoanalytic movement over which he had to preside.</p><p>Praise for Adam Phillips<br> &nbsp;<br> Adam Phillips is one of the richest and most rewarding essayists of our time." <i>Los Angeles Times</i><br> &nbsp;<br> Phillips has made psychoanalytic thought livelier and more poetic than ever.&#x201d;�� <i>New York Times</i><br> &nbsp;<br> The curious thing about reading Phillips is that he makes you feel smart and above the daily grind at the same time as he reassures you that you are not alone in your primal anxieties about whether you are lovable or nuts or, perhaps, merely boring.&#x201d; <i>New York Times Magazine</i><br> &nbsp;<br> Adam Phillips writes with far-sighted equanimity. . . . He&#x2019;s a little like an Oliver Sacks of psychoanalysis, both affable and unalarmed.&#x201d; <i>Boston Sunday Globe</i><br> &nbsp;<br> [Phillips is] one of the finest prose stylists at work in the language, an Emerson of our time.&#x201d; John Banville<br> &nbsp;<br> "Phillips&#x2019;s authority as a writer comes in no small part from his own experience as a highly regarded therapist." <i>Boston Globe</i><br> &nbsp;<br> "[Phillips is] adept at making the complex comprehensible.&#x201d; <i>Independent</i><br> &nbsp;<br> In&nbsp;Phillips&#x2019; hands, nothing is as ordinary as it appears to be. Each essay is a kind of mystery tour; you never know where you are going to end up.&#x201d; <i>Times Literary Supplement</i><br> &nbsp;<br> [Phillips has] punched lovely skylights into the gloomy Freudian edifice and in general done much to rehabilitate the psychoanalytic enterprise by honoring the idiosyncrasy of human experience and by wielding method lightly, playfully, humanely.&#x201d; <i>Esquire</i><b>Adam Phillips </b>is former Principal Child Psychotherapist at Charing Cross Hospital, London, and is now a psychoanalyst in private practice.

Simenon was legendary both for his literary skill&#x2013;four or five books every year for 40 years&#x2013;and his sexual capacity, at least to hear him tell it. What we can speak of with some certainty are the novels, which are tough, rigorously unsentimental and full of rage, duplicity and, occasionally, justice. Simenon's tone and dispassionate examination of humanity was echoed by Patricia Highsmith, who dispensed with the justice. So far, the Review has published <i>Tropic Moon, The Man Who Watched Trains Go By, Red Lights, Dirty Snow </i>and <i>Three Bedrooms in Manhattan</i>; <i>The Strangers in the House</i> comes out in November.

Noted philosopher Kwame Anthony Appiah shows us what it means to "do" philosophy in our time and why it should matter to anyone who wishes to live a more thoughtful life. Opposing the common misconceptions that being a philosopher means espousing a set of philosophical beliefs--or being a follower of a particular thinker--Appiah argues that "the result of philosophical exploration is not the end of inquiry in a settled opinion, but a mind resting more comfortably among many possibilities, or else the reframing of the question, and a new inquiry." <br> Ideal for introductory philosophy courses, <em>Thinking It Through</em> is organized around eight central topics--mind, knowledge, language, science, morality, politics, law, and metaphysics. It traces how philosophers in the past have considered each subject (how Hobbes, Wittgenstein, and Frege, for example, approached the problem of language) and then explores some of the major questions that still engage philosophers today. More importantly, Appiah not only explains what philosophers have thought but <em>how</em> they think, giving students examples that they can use in their own attempts to navigate the complex issues confronting any reflective person in the twenty-first century. Filled with concrete examples of how philosophers work, <em>Thinking it Through</em> guides students <em>through</em> the process of philosophical reflection and enlarges their understanding of the central questions of human life.<br></p><p>Kwane Anthony Appiah is the Laurance S. Rockefeller Professor of Philosophy and the University Center for Human Values at Princeton University.What legal and political circumstances justify civil disobedience? When does lying qualify as a moral act? It is by probing a wide range of such questions that a Princeton professor demonstrates what it means to do philosophy. Hoping to discipline readers in the systematic analysis of inquiries, Appiah shows the uninitiated how to weigh alternative perspectives and test the internal consistency of arguments. The alternative perspectives scrutinized include those of classic thinkers (including Plato, Descartes, and Kant), and the conundrums surveyed include many central to the philosophic tradition (such as the mind-body problem), but readers quickly learn how rigorous philosophical thinking can guide them through a thicket of contemporary issues not yet in the textbooks. Beginners who can't tell a "counterfactual" from a "foundational belief" soon find themselves understanding how such technical terms can tighten their reasoning about language, morality, politics, and other topics. By the time they finish the book, many readers will discover that their timid curiosity about philosophy has grown into a bold willingness to explore the professional literature. <i>Bryce Christensen</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

Here Mary Midgley does so, with her customary brilliance and clarity. In Wickedness she sets out to delineate not so much the nature of wickedness as its actual sources. Midgley&#39;s analysis proves that the capicity for real wickedness is an inevitable part of human nature. This is not, however, a blanket acceptance of evil. She provides us with a framework that accepts its existence yet offers humankind the possibility of rejecting this part of our nature. Out of this dark journey she returns with an offering to us: an understanding of human nature that enhances our very humanity.

Bracken Professor Emeritus of History at Ball State University, Muncie, Indiana, and a past President of the Western History Association. Published works she has authored include <i>Women and Nature: Saving the &#x201c;Wild&#x201d; West </i>and <i>Inventing the American Woman</i>To provide a factual and intimate biography of Annie Oakley, the legendary female sharpshooter and star of Buffalo Bill Cody's Wild West Show, Riley attempts to place her seemingly mythical subject firmly into historical, cultural, and sociological contexts. While faithfully recounting Oakley's personal and professional chronology and impressive list of accomplishments, the author also offers an interpretive view of Annie's highly successful effort to reconcile her public image as a resourceful and athletic western woman with her private perception of herself as a genteel Victorian lady and a model wife. What emerges is a multidimensional portrait of an entertainer and a businesswoman whose enduring fame and popularity both reflected and defied the conventions of her era. Unlike many previous Oakley biographers, Riley moves well beyond the realm of folklore, producing an insightful and original account of the life, the times, and the significance of a uniquely American heroine. <i>Margaret Flanagan</i></p><h2>A Deeper Look at the Fruit of the Spirit: Growing in the Likeness of Christ (LifeGuide� in Depth Series)</h2><p>A deep look at Scripture&#x2015;God's very words&#x2015;is never wasted.

And although he is favorably compared with Franz Kafka, Samuel Beckett, and Robert Musil, Thomas Bernhard still remains relatively unknown in America.<br><br>Uninitiated readers should consider <i>Three Novellas</i> a passport to the absurd, dark, and uncommonly comic world of Bernhard. Two of the three novellas here have never before been published in English, and all of them show an early preoccupation with the themes-illness and madness, isolation, tragic friendships-that would obsess Bernhard throughout his career. <i>Amras</i>, one of his earliest works, tells the story of two brothers, one epileptic, who have survived a family suicide pact and are now living in a ruined tower, struggling with madness, trying either to come fully back to life or finally to die. In <i>Playing Watten</i>, the narrator, a doctor who lost his practice due to morphine abuse, describes a visit paid him by a truck driver who wanted the doctor to return to his habit of playing a game of cards (watten) every Wednesday&#x2014;a habit that the doctor had interrupted when one of the players killed himself. The last novella, <i>Walking</i>, records the conversations of the narrator and his friend Oehler while they walk, discussing anything that comes to mind but always circling back to their mutual friend Karrer, who has gone irrevocably mad. Perhaps the most overtly philosophical work in Bernhard's highly philosophical oeuvre, <i>Walking</i> provides a penetrating meditation on the impossibility of truly thinking.<br><br><i>Three Novellas</i> offers a superb introduction to the fiction of perhaps the greatest unsung hero of twentieth-century literature. Rarely have the words <i>suffocating</i>, <i>intense</i>, and <i>obsessive</i> been meant so positively.</p><p><b>Thomas Bernhard</b> (1931-1989) grew up in Salzburg and Vienna, where he studied music. In 1957 he began a second career as a playwright, poet, and novelist. He went on to win many of the most prestigious literary prizes of Europe (including the Austrian State Prize, the Bremen and Br�chner prizes, and Le Prix S�guier), became one of the most widely admired writers of his generation, and insisted at his death that none of his works be published in Austria for seventy years, a provision later repealed by his half-brother. The University of Chicago Press has published eleven of his books in English translation, including, most recently, <i>Extinction</i>, <i>The Loser</i>, and <i>The Voice Imitator</i>.&#x201c;On picking up <i>Three Novellas</i> . . . the reader is instantly transported into the comic nightmare we recognize from Bernhard&#x2019;s longer novels and theater: It is Bernhard&#x2019;s postwar Austria, menacing, provincial, suffocating, where the beauty of the Alpine setting serves as a mask of hypocrisy concealing guilt and decay. . . . What is particularly exciting in the three short pieces included in this new collection is the chance to see a younger Bernhard working on a concise scale with motifs and methods he will expand into the longer works considered his masterpieces. At the same time, the works here give us a glimpse of roads not taken, experiments with pathos and plot that the writer let fall away as he refined his vision and technique.&#x201d; (<i>Chicago Tribune</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;&#x2018;Why do we still have to live,&#x2019; a survivor of a family suicide pact asks in the first of these novellas, all of which revolve around madness or suicide. The Austrian master Bernhard, whose thirty-year career was devoted to the proposition that to be born is a tragedy and that to live is a punishment nobody deserves to suffer, never managed to come up with a satisfactory answer. These novellas are early works, but the point of view that found devastating expression in masterpieces like <i>Concrete </i>and <i>Yes </i>is already apparent. What is extraordinary about Bernhard is that his relentless pessimism never seems open to ridicule; his world is so powerfully imagined that it can seem to surround you like little else in literature.&#x201d; (<i>New Yorker</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;<i>Amras</i>, <i>Playing Watten</i>, and <i>Walking</i> . . . reveal that the Austrian had a penchant for morbidity and isolation from the start. . . . The books&#x2019; unselfconscious absurdities are hilarious, but their near disregard for the reader also generates a peculiar intimacy: It&#x2019;s as if you&#x2019;re experiencing the thoughts firsthand, getting swept up in the ruminations as they approach a fever pitch. . . . It&#x2019;s fascinating to watch the author slowly cordon off a space where characters can exist entirely on their own terms, no matter how tortured they claim to be by the world around them. &#x201d; (<i>Village Voice</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;Reading Thomas Bernhard&#x2019;s <i>Three Novellas</i> was like revisiting my teenage obsession with gothic music and <i>The Metamorphosis</i> and realizing that maybe it wasn&#x2019;t so corny after all. The subject matter in the three short works in this collection ranges from suicide and madness, to suicide and addiction, and back to madness (without the suicide), but does so deftly and stylishly, giving audiences unfamiliar with Bernhard&#x2019;s longer works a good introduction to this challenging Austrian writer without feeling too <i>goth</i>. . . . Bernhard is one of a kind. More audiences should familiarize themselves with his skillful, challenging writing. . . . So dust off your Bauhaus records and throw one on the turntable, enjoying them again as the soundtrack to Bernhard&#x2019;s bleak, beautiful landscape.&#x201d; (<i>Bookslut</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;In <i>Amras</i>, the first of the three novellas, Bernhard has not yet found his form. But in <i>Playing Watten</i> and in <i>Walking</i>, we see burgeoning signs of one of the most distinct literary voices of the twentieth century. . . . <i>Playing Watten</i> and in <i>Walking</i> are small treasures, and in its totality, <i>Three Novellas</i> . . . is an important addition to Bernhardt&#x2019;s translated oeuvre.&#x201d; (<i>Rain Taxi</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;Bernhard&#x2019;s writing is not easy, but the payoff is in witnessing a world so thoroughly mad, so exactingly dark that it is hilarious&#x2014;hilarious not because Bernhard is ridiculous, or unbelievable, but because he succeeds in making his stories totally believable and life so ridiculous.&#x201d; (<i>Portland Mercury</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;Embedded in Bernhard&#x2019;s striking achievement as a writer lies an interesting, perhaps troubling, question. Why should such a gloomy, ill-tempered, unreasonable, and relentlessly pessimistic vision of life be so exhilarating to read? . . . Entering Bernhard&#x2019;s world means suspending the tyranny of good taste, conventional wishes, and the false comforts of the consumerist lifestyle. It means entering a realm of thoughtful perversity. . . . Bernhard&#x2019;s novellas also invite us to contemplate the place of beauty in the world. Like freedom and fulfillment, it is conspicuous in its absence, or seeming absence, in Bernhard&#x2019;s vision of life since the end of World War II. . . . Bernhard&#x2019;s prose exhilarates because we thrill to the beauty of his thorny, tough way of invoking what really matters in life. And this is not despite his fiction&#x2019;s gloomy pessimism but because of it. The collision between style and content strikes sparks bright enough to illuminate a good deal.&#x201d; (<i>World and I</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;For some readers, Bernhard&#x2019;s reported speech technique may not overcome an inculcated preference for conventional representations of dialogue. Having characters dwell obsessively on fine points might seem nothing short of maddening, in which case reading Bernhard will be like death by pushpin. But for those who can bear the hypnotic sentences and who will engage the grim mind behind them, <i>Three Novellas</i>, particularly &#x2018;Walking,&#x2019; will be refreshing, and a stimulus to thinking about other ways to conceive of fiction.&#x201d; (<i>Books in Canada</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;In whatever story, the nameless narrator is always immersed in abstract thinking that becomes impossible because of imminent death or the collapse of identity under the weight of the oppressive point of view. Bernhard&#x2019;s ranting allows the reader no space to breathe, building up more and more tension in both the reader and the narrator. At the same time, the prose can almost intoxicate with its musical rhythms. It is Bernhard&#x2019;s sense of humor that makes these books accessible to most readers, especially the way her refuses ever to commit to any position, while firmly grounding his characters in absurdity that keeps the reader off-guard and giddy.&#x201d; (<i>Magill&#x2019;s Literary Annual 2004</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;A welcome addition to the translated oeuvre of one of this century&#x2019;s most important and celebrated (outside the United States) writers.&#x201d; (<i>Review of Contemporary Fiction</i>)</p><h2>Man As Symphony of the Creative Word</h2><p>In this important series of lectures, given near the end of his life, Rudolf Steiner brought together many aspects of his research into man and nature. The first three lectures show us man&#39;s inner relationship to the ancient and sacred animal representatives -- eagle, lion, and bull -- and to the forces of the cosmos that form them. This insight is deepened in the second group of lectures by approaching the plant and animal worlds in the context of spiritual evolution. The third group gives a unique and intimate description of the elemental nature spirits -- the purely spiritual beings that complement plants and animals -- and the cooperation these beings offer to mankind. In the fourth series, man himself is placed in this harmony of nature -- in the symphony of the Creative Word.</p><p>Text: English, German (translation)</p><h2>The Challenge of Democracy: American Government in Global Politics (with MindTap Political Science, 1 term (6 months) Printed Access Card)</h2><p>This best-selling American government book is highly acclaimed for the non-ideological framework it uses to explore three themes: freedom, order, and equality as political values; the majoritarianism versus pluralism debate; and globalization&#39;s effect on American politics.

After he died of blood poisoning en route to Gallipoli in 1915, the poet's valor and godlike good looks were soon immortalized. He never had the chance to prove the former save in a handful of verses that are far from his finest, but photographic proof of the latter was unassailable. When Brooke's letters were originally published in 1968, his executor and editor, Geoffrey Keynes, kept well clear of his extensive correspondence with James Strachey (brother of Lytton and now best remembered for his translations of Freud). Keynes went so far as to claim that they would appear in print "over my dead body." Nothing less than homosexual panic was at the heart of such hysteria: Brooke was to be forever deified, not damned as a sodomite. <p> Now Keith Hale has whittled down Brooke and Strachey's letters and postcards between 1905 and 1914 into a volume in which the inconsequential ("Thursday lunch will be admirably suitable") bumps up against history, emotion, and desire. The last few years of their friendship were decidedly rocky, and Strachey's final words on his complex friend are apposite: "Rupert wasn't nearly so nice as people now imagine; but he was a great deal cleverer." Whether you read their correspondence as proof positive of Brooke's bi- or homosexuality will depend on your views of the construction of sexual identity. But it must be said that the poet's account of one schoolboy seduction is written with an icy objectivity that even Edmund White would envy. These letters remain a fascinating record of longtime companionship--no matter how you use that term. <i>--Kerry Fried</i></p>Keith Hale is editor of Friends &amp; Apostles: The Correspondence of Rupert Brooke and James Strachey, 1905-1914, published by Yale University Press, and author of the novels Cody and What Daniel Did with His Life, both available from Watersgreen House.

The book, which many will find controversial, details Stein&#x2019;s pilgrimage in search of the authentic current of Chinese tradition, a search that leads him to denounce the country&#x2019;s so-called economic miracle as a general collapse. . . . Stein is only too aware that he is at odds with the times, and that perhaps he is beyond understanding modern China. . . . Such is the sorrow of the title of this book, a long lament for the final ancient civilization of world history.

There is a literary sensibility to the writing that is unmatched by any other book I can recall in this vaguely-defined genre. Krasznahorkai&#x2019;s intellect radiates from the pages.

But the last thing Krasznahorkai is ever going to offer us is false hope or neat resolutions.&#x201d; (Epler, Barbara <i>TANK Magazine</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;Masterfully translated by Mulzet, <i>Destruction and Sorrow beneath the Heavens</i> . . . bridges the dark visions of Krasznahorkai&#x2019;s earlier work to the Buddhist-like meditations of his more recent books. . . . Krasznahorkai allows himself to take pleasure in appreciating the past rather than decrying it&#x2019;s loss. . . . Less of a travelogue than a personal document for the writer, a critical artistic step that has taken him to a more sublime era of his career.&#x201d; (<i>Frieze</i>)<br><br>"In <i>Destruction and Sorrow beneath the Heavens</i>, Asia is once again at the center of Krasznahorkai&#x2019;s<br> attention, but this time he sends his protagonist Stein to China to discover if and how the country&#x2019;s classical culture lives on in the twenty-first century. . . .

It is by far the most enjoyable introduction to Haywood and the eighteenth-century novel that one could hope for.&#x201d; &#x2015; Patrick Spedding, Monash University </p></p><h2>Fashions of a Decade: The 1930s</h2><p>Examines the role of fashion as it made its way through the Great Depression, exploring the social and cultural aspects of history through a softer lens. Cheaper fabrics that imitated luxury items such as nylon and artificial silks became popular, along with clothing that featured a more muted palette and longer, more flowing lines.</p><p>Maria Costantino was born in Chicago, Illinois and has written such other titles as "The Handbook: Household Hints &amp; Tips," "DIY Encyclopedia," "First Aid Pocket Guide" and many other books on food, drink, art, design and fashion. She teaches Historical, Critical and Theoretical Studies at several universities and colleges in England, and now lives by the sea in Sussex.Grade 7 Up-- Baker explains how Nazi invasions and Japanese bombings forced rapid economic and therefore fashion change. Rationing became the order of the day. To save material, skirts narrowed and shortened; the midriff was bared in swim suits; pockets, buttons, and trim were regulated; and attached coathoods were banned. Costantino looks at The 1930s , when 23 million people were out of work; even the rich found it necessary to watch expenditures carefully, and Coco Chanel reduced her prices by 50%. Splashed with full-color photos and illlustrations, plenty of verve, and enticing information, both books connect political and social history with the reasons people chose particular dress modes. The reading lists and other reference aids make them handy for researchers, but they are also delightful to browse through and certain to lead young people to ponder their own sartorial choices. Two books that will be interesting to anyone searching for the whys and wherefores of human identity.<br><i>- Cindy Darling Codell, Clark Middle School, Winchester, KY</i><br>Copyright 1992 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Third Industrial Revolution: How Lateral Power Is Transforming Energy, the Economy, and the World</h2><p><p>The Industrial Revolution, powered by oil and other fossil fuels, is spiraling into a dangerous endgame. The price of gas and food are climbing, unemployment remains high, the housing market has tanked, consumer and government debt is soaring, and the recovery is slowing. Facing the prospect of a second collapse of the global economy, humanity is desperate for a sustainable economic game plan to take us into the future.</p><p>Here, Jeremy Rifkin explores how Internet technology and renewable energy are merging to create a powerful "Third Industrial Revolution." He asks us to imagine hundreds of millions of people producing their own green energy in their homes, offices, and factories, and sharing it with each other in an "energy internet," just like we now create and share information online.</p><p>Rifkin describes how the five-pillars of the Third Industrial Revolution will create thousands of businesses, millions of jobs, and usher in a fundamental reordering of human relationships, from hierarchical to lateral power, that will impact the way we conduct commerce, govern society, educate our children, and engage in civic life.</p><p>Rifkin's vision is already gaining traction in the international community. The European Union Parliament has issued a formal declaration calling for its implementation, and other nations in Asia, Africa, and the Americas, are quickly preparing their own initiatives for transitioning into the new economic paradigm.</p><p><i>The Third Industrial Revolution</i> is an insider's account of the next great economic era, including a look into the personalities and players &#x2015; heads of state, global CEOs, social entrepreneurs, and NGOs &#x2015; who are pioneering its implementation around the world.</p></p><p><p><b>Jeremy Rifkin</b> is president of the Foundation on Economic Trends and the author of eighteen bestselling books, including <i>The Hydrogen Economy</i> and <i>The End of Work</i>. He has been a guest on <i>Face the Nation</i>, <i>The Lehrer News Hour</i>, <i>20/20</i>, <i>Larry King Live</i>, <i>Today</i>, and <i>Good Morning America</i>. <i>The National Journal</i> named Rifkin as one of 150 people in the U.S. that have the most influence in shaping federal government policy. He has also testified before numerous congressional committees, and since 1994, Mr. Rifkin has been a senior lecturer at the Wharton School's Executive Education Program at the University of Pennsylvania.</p><p>Rifkin is chairman of the Global CEO Business Roundtable, which includes IBM, Cisco, Cushman and Wakefield, and has served as an adviser to various global leaders, including Nicolas Sarkozy of France and Angela Merkel of Germany. His monthly column on global issues appears in many of the world's leading newspapers and magazines, including <i>The Los Angeles Times</i>,<i> The Guardian</i> in the U.K., <i>Die S�ddeutsche Zeitung</i> in Germany,<i> Trud</i> in Bulgaria, <i>Clar�n</i> in Argentina, and <i>Al-Ittihad</i> in the U.A.E. He lives in Bethesda, MD.</p><p>&#x201c;Jeremy Rifkin was always ahead of his time. The <i>New Industrial Revolution </i>confirms that the times have caught up with him. It is no longer possible to ignore his vision for the future of humankind.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Calestous Juma, Harvard Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs, John F.

As we look to regrow the economy, generate millions of jobs, and create a sustainable future for our children, the Third Industrial Revolution offers an indispensable roadmap.&#x201d; &#x2015;Arianna Huffington, President and Editor-in-Chief of The Huffington Post Media Group</p><p>&#x201c;Mr. Rifkin clearly outlines the challenges facing our global community, and creates a vision for business leaders, government and citizens.&#x201d; &#x2015;John Chambers, Chairman and CEO of Cisco</p><p>&#x201c;The creative thinking of Jeremy Rifkin has been inspiring policy makers and citizens alike.

While Binmore uses a light touch to outline key developments in theory, the text remains a serious exposition of a serious topic. In addition, his unique story-telling approach allows students to immediately apply game-theoretic skills to simple problems. Each chapter ends with a host of challenging exercises to help students practice the skills they have learned. The highly anticipated revision, expected in 2003, will include more coverage of cooperative game theory and a more accessible presentation&#x2014;with chapters broken up into smaller chunks and an abundance of economic examples integrated throughout the text.</p></p><p></p><h2>Inventing Reality: The Politics of News Media</h2><p>Taking a critical perspective on the economics and politics of &#34;presenting&#34; the news, this topical supplement argues that the media systematically distorts news coverage.</p><p></p><h2>We the People, Vol. 1: Foundations</h2><p><p> Bruce Ackerman offers a sweeping reinterpretation of our nation's constitutional experience and its promise for the future. Integrating themes from American history, political science, and philosophy, <i>We the People</i> confronts the past, present, and future of popular sovereignty in America. Only this distinguished scholar could present such an insightful view of the role of the Supreme Court. Rejecting arguments of judicial activists, proceduralists, and neoconservatives, Ackerman proposes a new model of judicial interpretation that would synthesize the constitutional contributions of many generations into a coherent whole. The author ranges from examining the origins of the dualist tradition in the <i>Federalist Papers</i> to reflecting upon recent, historic constitutional decisions. The latest revolutions in civil rights, and the right to privacy, are integrated into the fabric of constitutionalism. Today's Constitution can best be seen as the product of three great exercises in popular sovereignty, led by the Founding Federalists in the 1780s, the Reconstruction Republicans in the 1860s, and the New Deal Democrats in the 1930s. </p><p> Ackerman examines the roles played during each of these periods by the Congress, the Presidency, and the Supreme Court. He shows that Americans have built a distinctive type of constitutional democracy, unlike any prevailing in Europe. It is a dualist democracy, characterized by its continuing effort to distinguish between two kinds of politics: normal politics, in which organized interest groups try to influence democratically elected representatives; and constitutional politics, in which the mass of citizens mobilize to debate matters of fundamental principle. Although American history is dominated by normal politics, our tradition places a higher value on mobilized efforts to gain the consent of the people to new governing principles.In a dualist democracy, the rare triumphs of constitutional politics determine the course of normal politics.More than a decade in the making, and the first of three volumes, this compelling book speaks to all who seek to renew and redefine our civic commitments in the decades ahead. </p></p><p><b>Bruce Ackerman</b> is Sterling Professor of Law and Political Science at Yale University.From distinguished legal scholar Ackerman (Law &amp; Political Science/Yale; Reconstructing American Law, 1984, etc.)--an original and insightful study of the theoretical and historical evolution of the Constitution, and its meaning in modern times. Ackerman creates analytical categories that define both America's distinctive constitutional system and its transformative constitutional experiences. He says that while the American democratic system borrowed much from European theory, Americans have created a novel constitutional system that, unlike the British or German models, distinguishes between two types of politics. In ``normal politics,'' a politically disengaged populace permits interest groups to lobby democratically elected representatives while the representatives make policy, and in ``constitutional politics,'' society mobilizes to debate matters of fundamental principle. Ackerman sees three great transformative movements of constitutional politics--the establishment of the basic framework in the 1780's, the reforms of the Reconstruction Republicans in the 1860's, and those of the New Deal Democrats in the 1930's (who effected their sweeping reinterpretation of the Constitution by means of seminal Supreme Court decisions rather than by Constitutional amendments). Each of these movements, the author says, was characterized by legal creativity bordering on illegality (the framing of the Constitution did not use the amendment process of the then-regnant Articles of Confederation, and the Thirteenth and Fourteenth Amendments did not use the amendment process of Article Five of the Constitution), but, Ackerman argues, each was an authentic response to political crises of its time and was ultimately legitimized by the people. While Ackerman admires the Constitution, he is not blind to its faults or to its historical and imperfect compromises. However, he calls on private American citizens--those whose concern with government competes with other personal concerns--to work for the fulfillment of its egalitarian promises. A thoughtful, informative, and inspiring introduction to our national bedrock. -- <i>Copyright �1991, Kirkus Associates, LP.

They seized his computer and photo equipment and brought him to the parking lot of my hotel. There they made him call me and ask me to come down to talk to them. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m in trouble here,&#x201d; he told me. It was after dark. I did not want to go down to meet a bunch of ISI men, but I told my colleague I would get help. I alerted my editor in New York.<br><br>Before I could reach any Pakistani officials, the agents raided my hotel room. I had earlier refused to admit them, but now they got the hotel staff to open the door with a key card, and then they broke through the door chain. The lintel splintered. They burst in in a rush, snatching my laptop from my hands. They were plainclothes intelligence, I realized. Among them was an English-speaking officer wearing a smart new khaki-colored fleece. The other three were the muscle, in bulky winter jackets over dark-colored shalwar kamize, loose-fitting shirt and pants. One of them had the photographer in tow. <br><br>They went through my clothes and seized my computer, notebooks, and a cell phone. When one of the muscle men grabbed my handbag from me, I protested. He punched me twice, hard, in the face and temple, knocking me over. I fell back onto the coffee table, smashing the cups there, grabbing at the officer&#x2019;s fleece to break my fall and nearly pulling him down on top of me. For a moment it was funny.

No book since Mrs. Shelley's <i>Frankenstein</i> or indeed any other at all has come near yours in originality, or terror.'<br><br>A popular bestseller in Victorian England, Stoker's hypnotic tale of the bloodthirsty Count Dracula, whose nocturnal atrocities are symbolic of an evil ages old yet forever new, endures as the quintessential story of suspense and horror. The unbridled lusts and desires, the diabolical cravings that Stoker dramatized with such mythical force, render Dracula resonant and unsettling a century later.</p><p><i>Dracula</i> is one of the few horror books to be honored by inclusion in the Norton Critical Edition series. (The others are <i>Frankenstein,</i> <i>The Turn of the Screw,</i> <i>Heart of Darkness,</i> <i>The Picture of Dorian Gray,</i> and <i>The Metamorphosis.</i>) This 100th-anniversary edition includes not only the complete authoritative text of the novel with illuminating footnotes, but also four contextual essays, five reviews from the time of publication, five articles on dramatic and film variations, and seven selections from literary and academic criticism. Nina Auerbach of the University of Pennsylvania (author of <i>Our Vampires, Ourselves</i>) and horror scholar David J. Skal (author of <i>Hollywood Gothic</i>, <i>The Monster Show</i>, and <i>Screams of Reason</i>) are the editors of the volume. Especially fascinating are excerpts from materials that Bram Stoker consulted in his research for the book, and his working papers over the several years he was composing it. The selection of criticism includes essays on how <i>Dracula</i> deals with female sexuality, gender inversion, homoerotic elements, and Victorian fears of "reverse colonization" by politically turbulent Transylvania.While serving as actor Henry Irving&#39;s business manager at the Lyceum Theatre in London, Bram Stoker (1847-1912) also pursued his literary interests. In this Gothic horror novel of 1897, which brought him international fame, he presents the chilling vampire Count Dracula, modelled in part on Irving&#39;s powerful personality.</p><h2>The Powers of Poetry</h2><p>39 introductory essays on poetic technique, the lives of individual poets, mood and individual poems, and the values of poetry</p><p></p><h2>The Song of Songs: A Biography (Lives of Great Religious Books, 46)</h2><p><p><b>An essential history of the greatest love</b><b> poem ever written</b></p><p>The Song of Songs has been embraced for centuries as the ultimate song of love. But the kind of love readers have found in this ancient poem is strikingly varied. Ilana Pardes invites us to explore the dramatic shift from readings of the Song as a poem on divine love to celebrations of its exuberant account of human love. With a refreshingly nuanced approach, she reveals how allegorical and literal interpretations are inextricably intertwined in the Song's tumultuous life. The body in all its aspects&#x2015;pleasure and pain, even erotic fervor&#x2015;is key to many allegorical commentaries. And although the literal, sensual Song thrives in modernity, allegory has not disappeared. New modes of allegory have emerged in modern settings, from the literary and the scholarly to the communal.</p><p>Offering rare insights into the story of this remarkable poem, Pardes traces a diverse line of passionate readers. She looks at Jewish and Christian interpreters of late antiquity who were engaged in disputes over the Song's allegorical meaning, at medieval Hebrew poets who introduced it into the opulent world of courtly banquets, and at kabbalists who used it as a springboard to the celestial spheres. She shows how feminist critics have marveled at the Song's egalitarian representation of courtship, and how it became a song of America for Walt Whitman, Herman Melville, and Toni Morrison. Throughout these explorations of the Song's reception, Pardes highlights the unparalleled beauty of its audacious language of love.</p></p><p>This book takes the reader on a tour of popular understandings throughout history of the most erotic part of the Bible: the love poem known as the Song of Songs (AKA the Song of Solomon).<b>Ilana Pardes</b> is the Katharine Cornell Professor of Comparative Literature at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. She is the author of <i>Countertraditions in the Bible</i>, <i>The Biography of Ancient Israel</i>, <i>Melville's Bibles</i>, and <i>Agnon's Moonstruck Lovers</i>.</p><h2>Localization in Clinical Neurology</h2><p>This updated Fourth Edition remains the most practical reference available on localization in clinical neurology.

Waverley was first published anonymously in 1814 and was Scott&#39;s first novel.</p><p>Sir Walter Scott was born in Edinburgh in 1771. Educated for the law, he obtained the office of sheriff-depute of Selkirkshire in 1799 and in 1806 the office of clerk of session, a post whose duties he fulfilled for some twenty-five years. His lifelong interest in Scottish antiquity and the ballads which recorded Scottish history led him to try his hand at narrative poems of adventure and action. <b>The Lay of the Last Minstrel</b> (1805), <b>Marmion</b> (1808), and <b>The Lady of the Lake</b> (1810) made his reputation as one of the leading poets of his time. A novel, <b>Waverley</b>, which he had begun in 1805, was published anonymously in 1814. Subsequent novels appeared with the note &#x201c;by the author of Waverley&#x201d;; hence his novels often are called collectively &#x201c;the Waverley novels.&#x201d; Some of the most famous of these are <b>Old Mortality</b> (1816), <b>Rob Roy</b> (1817), <b>Ivanhoe</b> (1819), <b>Kenilworth</b> (1821), and <b>Quentin Durward</b> (1823). In recognition of his literary work Scott was made a baronet in 1819. During his last years he held various official positions and published biographies, editions of Swift and Dryden, tales, lyric poetry, and various studies of history and antiquity. He died in 1832.</p><h2>The Chinese Economy: Transitions and Growth (The MIT Press)</h2><p><p>This comprehensive overview of the modern Chinese economy by a noted expert on China's economic development offers a quality and breadth of coverage not found in any other English-language text. In <i>The Chinese Economy</i>, Barry Naughton provides both an engaging, broadly focused introduction to China's economy since 1949 and original insights based on his own extensive research. The book will be an essential resource for students, teachers, scholars, business people, and policymakers. It is suitable for classroom use for undergraduate or graduate courses.</p><p>After presenting background material on the pre-1949 economy and the industrialization, reform, and market transition that have taken place since, the book examines different aspects of the modern Chinese economy. It analyzes patterns of growth and development, including population growth and the one-child family policy; the rural economy, including agriculture and rural industrialization; industrial and technological development in urban areas; international trade and foreign investment; macroeconomic trends and cycles and the financial system; and the largely unaddressed problems of environmental quality and the sustainability of growth.</p><p>The text is notable also for placing China's economy in interesting comparative contexts, discussing it in relation to other transitional or developing economies and to such advanced industrial countries as the United States and Japan. It provides both a broad historical and macro perspective as well as a focused examination of the actual workings of China's complex and dynamic economic development. Interest in the Chinese economy will only grow as China becomes an increasingly important player on the world's stage. This book will be the standard reference for understanding and teaching about the next economic superpower.</p></p><p>Barry Naughton is Sokwanlok Chair of Chinese International Affairs in the School of Global Policy and Strategy at the University of California, San Diego.

It is a portrait of a beautiful and intelligent woman whose passionate love for a handsome officer sweeps aside all other ties - to her marriage and to the network of relationships and moral values that bind the society around her. The love affair of Anna and Vronsky is played out alongside the developing romance of Kitty and Levin, and in the character of Levin, closely based on Tolstoy himself, the search for happiness takes on a deeper philosophical significance. <br><br>One of the greatest novels ever written, <em>Anna Karenina</em> combines penetrating psychological insight with an encyclopedic depiction of Russian life in the 1870s. The novel takes us from high society St Petersburg to the threshing fields on Levin's estate, with unforgettable scenes at a Moscow ballroom, the skating rink, a race course, a railway station. It creates an intricate labyrinth of connections that is profoundly satisfying, and deeply moving. <br><br>Rosamund Bartlett's translation conveys Tolstoy's precision of meaning and emotional accuracy in an English version that is highly readable and stylistically faithful.

Through a series of brilliant epiphanies that parallel the development of his own aesthetic consciousness, Joyce evokes Stephen&#39;s youth, from his impressionable years as the youngest student at the Clongowed Wood school to the deep religious conflict he experiences at a day school in Dublin, and finally to his college studies where he challenges the conventions of his upbringing and his understanding of faith and intellectual freedom. James Joyce&#39;s highly autobiographical novel was first published in the United States in 1916 to immediate acclaim. Ezra Pound accurately predicted that Joyce&#39;s book would &#34;remain a permanent part of English literature,&#34; while H.G. Wells dubbed it &#34;by far the most important living and convincing picture that exists of an Irish Catholic upbringing.&#34; A remarkably rich study of a developing young mind, &#34;A Portrait Of The Artist As A Young Man made an indelible mark on literature and confirmed Joyce&#39;s reputation as one of the world&#39;s greatest and lasting writers.</p><h2>Martin Luther King (The Oxford Bookworms Library Factfiles)</h2><p>Features <strong>topics</strong> such as environmental issues, historical facts, and culture.<br><br><strong>Full-color</strong> photographs, introductions, glossaries, and exercises enhance student reading and learning.<br><br><strong>Audio</strong> versions of selected titles provide great models of intonation and pronunciation of difficult words.<br><br><b>Book Details:</b><ul><li>Format: Paperback</li><li>Publication Date: 2/18/2008</li><li>Pages: 72</li><li>Reading Level: Age 8 and Up</li></ul></p><p>Alan C McLean has over thirty years' experience in the field of English as a foreign language as a teacher, teacher-trainer, textbook author, editor, and project consultant.

In recent decades fresh textual interpretations, numerous new archaeological discoveries and a much broader analytical focus emphasising social, economic, political and cultural approaches have transformed our understanding of ancient warfare. Volume II of this two-volume History reflects these developments and provides a systematic account, written by a distinguished cast of contributors, of the various themes underlying the warfare of the Roman world from the Late Republic to the sixth-century empire of Justinian and his successors. For each broad period developments in troop-types, equipment, strategy and tactics are discussed. These are placed in the broader context of developments in international relations and the relationship of warfare to both the state and wider society. Numerous illustrations, a glossary and chronology, and information about the authors mentioned supplement the text. This will become the primary reference work for specialists and non-specialists alike.</p><p>Second volume of a systematic account of the various themes underlying the warfare of the Roman world from the Late Republic to the sixth-century empire of Justinian and his successors.

A rich and representative selection of Akhmatova&#x2019;s work&#x2015;from her poignant, deeply personal love poems to her haunting laments for the martyrs of the Stalinist purges&#x2015;has been newly translated by the American poet Lyn Coffin. In her finely crafted translations Coffin has been uniquely successful in reproducing the directness and striking effects characteristic of Akhmatova&#x2019;s poetry, and she is the first to remain true to Akhmatova&#x2019;s rhyme and cadence. The poems are prefaced by a thoughtful introduction by the poet Joseph Brodsky, a friend of Akhmatova in her later years.</p><p>Anna Akhmatova <b> </b>was born Anna Gorenko in 1888 and died in 1966. A popular poet of the Acmeist school, she took a pseudonym when her upper-class father objected to her "decadent" choice of career. She was married to the Acmeist poet Gumilev from 1910 until 1918, and spent time in Paris, where she posed nude for Modigliani. After the Revolution, Akhmatova remained silent for two decades. Her ex-husband was executed in 1921, their son was imprisoned for sixteen years, and her third husband died in a Siberian prison camp. She began publishing again at the outbreak of World War II, and her writings regained popularity despite being harshly denounced by the Soviet regime in 1946 and 1957 for "bourgeois decadence." Ejected from the Writers' Union in 1946, she was made its president two years before her death in 1966. Her greatest poem, <b>"Requiem,"</b> gives voice to the suffering of those who, like the poet, spent many years waiting outside prison walls for word of their sons, husbands, or lovers. It was not published in its entirety in Russia until 1987. <br> <br>Peter Washington is the editor of many of the Everyman's Library Pocket Poets, including <b>Love Poems</b>, and is the author of Madame Blavatsky's <b>Baboon: A History of the Mystics</b>, <b>Mediums</b>, and <b>Misfits Who Brought Spiritualism to America</b>.No Bio <br> <br>No Bio <br> <br>No Bio</p><h2>Idioms of the Greek New Testament (Biblical Languages: Greek)</h2><p><p>The Greek grammar, newly revised and reset for the second edition, which is also available in paperback, can be used as an instructive handbook, as an intermediate level textbook and as a basic reference work to New Testament Greek.

This richly illustrated book explores how radical couture, avant-garde sportswear, and state-of-the-art military garments&#x2015;as seen through the lens of the superhero&#x2015;can be metaphors for sex, power, and politics. Beginning with the origins of the superhero costume, this volume looks at how designers have been influenced by iconographic components such as the cape, mask, boots, and unitard.

Here Andrew W. Lo and A. Craig MacKinlay put the Random Walk Hypothesis to the test. In this volume, which elegantly integrates their most important articles, Lo and MacKinlay find that markets are not completely random after all, and that predictable components do exist in recent stock and bond returns. Their book provides a state-of-the-art account of the techniques for detecting predictabilities and evaluating their statistical and economic significance, and offers a tantalizing glimpse into the financial technologies of the future.</p><br><p> The articles track the exciting course of Lo and MacKinlay's research on the predictability of stock prices from their early work on rejecting random walks in short-horizon returns to their analysis of long-term memory in stock market prices. A particular highlight is their now-famous inquiry into the pitfalls of "data-snooping biases" that have arisen from the widespread use of the same historical databases for discovering anomalies and developing seemingly profitable investment strategies. This book invites scholars to reconsider the Random Walk Hypothesis, and, by carefully documenting the presence of predictable components in the stock market, also directs investment professionals toward superior long-term investment returns through disciplined active investment management.</p></p><p><br> <p>"This provocative collection of essays provides careful empirical analyses of the major anomalies that have appeared in financial markets in the thirty-five years since Paul Cootner's influential <i>Random Character of Stock Market Prices</i>. It provides convincing evidence against the random walk as applied to stock markets, and at the same time warns us of the dangers of finding spurious anomalies. It is a worthy successor to Cootner's classic."<b>--Michael Brennan, University of California, Los Angeles</b><br> </p><br> <p>"This book is highly recommended to academic and private-sector economists who are interested in understanding better the behavior of financial market returns."<b>--Lars Peter Hansen, University of Chicago</b><br> </p><br> <p>"The common feature of this work . . . is that it is guided by simple economic intuitions while simultaneously being econometrically rigorous and careful."<b>--Bruce N.

But above all, Dicey would have to make sure to avoid the authorities who would split them up and place them in foster homes.

Fanny Burney&#39;s unusual love story and deft social satire was much admired on its first publication in 1782 for its subtle interweaving of comedy, humanity and social analysis.</p><p>This novel is an unusual and disturbing love-story. In playing on the issue of the heroine&#39;s name, the novel illustrates the high cost of a patriarchal system. Burney exhibits her powers as a comic writer and a satirist in depicting Cecilia&#39;s dismaying entry into the gilded fashionable world. This edition presents &#39;Cecilia&#39; as it first appeared in 1782, indicating changes Burney made to later editions.Frances Burney (Fanny Burney) was a British novelist who wrote four novels, eight plays, and one biography in her lifetime, and left behind 20 volumes of journals and letters after her death. Self-educated, Burney began writing at the age of 10, and published her first novel, Evelina, anonymously in 1778. Burney followed Evelina&#39;s success with Cecilia, Camilla, and The Wanderer, all of which explored the lives of English aristocrats and the role of women in society. Burney s novels were enormously popular during her lifetime, inspiring both Jane Austen and William Makepeace Thackeray, and her journals are recognized for their uncommonly accurate and candid portrayal of 18th-century England. Burney died in Bath, England, in 1840.</p><h2>The Saltwater Frontier: Indians and the Contest for the American Coast</h2><p><b>A fascinating new perspective on Native seafaring and colonial violence in the seventeenth-century American Northeast</b><br><br> Andrew Lipman&#x2019;s eye-opening first book is the previously untold story of how the ocean became a &#x201c;frontier&#x201d; between colonists and Indians. When the English and Dutch empires both tried to claim the same patch of coast between the Hudson River and Cape Cod, the sea itself became the arena of contact and conflict. During the violent European invasions, the region&#x2019;s Algonquian-speaking Natives were navigators, boatbuilders, fishermen, pirates, and merchants who became active players in the emergence of the Atlantic World. Drawing from a wide range of English, Dutch, and archeological sources, Lipman uncovers a new geography of Native America that incorporates seawater as well as soil. Looking past Europeans&#x2019; arbitrary land boundaries, he reveals unseen links between local episodes and global events on distant shores.<br> &nbsp;<br> Lipman&#x2019;s book &#x201c;successfully redirects the way we look at a familiar history&#x201d; (Neal Salisbury, Smith College).

First published in 1940, it focuses on the lynching of three innocent men and the tragedy that ensues when law and order are abandoned. The result is an emotionally powerful, vivid, and unforgettable re-creation of the Western novel, which Clark transmuted into a universal story about good and evil, individual and community, justice and human nature. As Wallace Stegner writes, [Clark's] theme was civilization, and he recorded, indelibly, its first steps in a new country.</p><p>Wallace Stegner's many books include <b>Crossing to Safety</b>, <b>Where the Bluebird Sings to the Lemonade Springs</b>, and the Pulitzer Prize winning <b>Angle of Repose</b>.1<br>Gil and I crossed the eastern divide about two by the sun. We pulled up for a look at the little town in the big valley and the mountains on the other side, with the crest of the Sierra showing faintly beyond like the rim of a day moon. We didn't look as long as we do sometimes; after winter range, we were excited about getting back to town. When the horses had stopped trembling from the last climb, Gil took off his sombrero, pushed his sweaty hair back with the same hand, and returned the sombrero, the way he did when something was going to happen. We reined to the right and went slowly down the steep stage road. It was a switch-back road, gutted by the run-off of the winter storms, and with brush beginning to grow up in it again since the stage had stopped running. In the pockets under the red earth banks, where the wind was cut off, the spring sun was hot as summer, and the air was full of a hot, melting pine smell. Rivulets of water trickled down shining on the sides of the cuts. The jays screeched in the trees and flashed through the sunlight in the clearings in swift, long dips. Squirrels and chipmunks chittered in the brush and along the tops of snow-sodden logs. On the outside turns, though, the wind got to us and dried the sweat under our shirts and brought up, instead of the hot resin, the smell of the marshy green valley. In the west the heads of a few clouds showed, the kind that come up with the early heat, but they were lying still, and over us the sky was clear and deep.<br>It was good to be on the loose on that kind of a day, but winter range stores up a lot of things in a man, and spring roundup hadn't worked them all out. Gil and I had been riding together for five years, and had the habit, but just the two of us in that shack in the snow had made us cautious. We didn't dare talk much, and we wanted to feel easy together again. When we came onto the last gentle slope into the valley, we let the horses out and loped across the flat between the marshes where the red-wing blackbirds were bobbing the reeds and twanging. Out in the big meadows on<br>both sides the long grass was bending in rows under the wind and shining, and then being let upright again and darkening, almost as if a cloud shadow had crossed it. With the wind we could hear the cows lowing in the north, a mellow sound at that distance, like little horns.<br><br>It was about three when we rode into Bridger's Wells, past the boarded-up church on the right, with its white paint half cracked off, and the houses back under the cottonwoods, or between rows of flickering poplars, every third or fourth one dead and leafless. Most of the yards were just let run<br>to long grass, and the buildings were log or unpainted board, but there were a few brick houses, and a few of painted clapboards with gimcracks around the veranda rails. Around them the grass was cut, and lilac bushes were planted in the shade. There were big purple cones of blossom on them. Already Bridger's Wells was losing its stage-stop look and beginning to settle into a half-empty village of the kind that hangs on sometimes where all the real work is spread out on the land around it, and most of the places take care of themselves.</p><h2>Relativistic Quantum Mechanics</h2><p>In this text the authors develop a propagator theory of Dirac particles, photons, and Klein-Gordon mesons and per- form a series of calculations designed to illustrate various useful techniques and concepts in electromagnetic, weak, and strong interactions. these include defining and implementing the renormalization program and evaluating effects of radia- tive corrections, such as the Lamb shift, in low-order calculations.

Alison Hart is a medium by trade: dead people talk to her, and she talks back. With her flat-eyed, flint-hearted sidekick, Colette, she tours the dormitory towns of London&#39;s orbital road, passing on messages from dead ancestors: &#39;Granny says she likes your new kitchen units.&#39; Alison&#39;s ability to communicate with spirits is a torment rather than a gift. Behind her plump, smiling and bland public persona is a desperate woman. She knows that the next life holds terrors that she must conceal from her clients. Her days and nights are haunted by the men she knew in her childhood, the thugs and petty criminals who preyed upon her hopeless, addled mother, Emmie. They infiltrate her house, her body and her soul; the more she tries to be rid of them, the stronger and nastier they become. This tenth novel by Hilary Mantel is a witty and deeply sinister story of dark secrets and forces, set in an England that jumps at its own shadow, a country whose banal self-absorption is shot through by fear of the engulfing dark.</p><p>Hilary Mantel was born in Derbyshire. She was educated at a convent and later studied law. After ten years abroad in Africa and the Middle East, she returned to Britain in 1985 to make a career as a writer.Beyond Black<br>oneTravelling: the dank oily days after Christmas. The motorway, its wastes looping London: the margin's scrub grass flaring orange in the lights, and the leaves of the poisoned shrubs striped yellow-green like a cantaloupe melon. Four o'clock: light sinking over the orbital road. Teatime in Enfield, night falling on Potter's Bar. There are nights when you don't want to do it, but you have to do it anyway. Nights when you look down from the stage and see closed stupid faces. Messages from the dead arrive at random. You don't want them and you can't send them back. The dead won't be coaxed and they won't be coerced. But the public has paid its money and it wants results.A sea-green sky: lamps blossoming white. This is marginal land: fields of strung wire, of treadless tyres in ditches, fridges dead on their backs, and starving ponies cropping the mud. It is a landscape running with outcasts and escapees, with Afghans, Turks and Kurds: with scapegoats, scarred with bottle and burn marks, limping from the cities with broken ribs. The life forms here are rejects, or anomalies: the cats tipped from speeding cars, and the Heathrow sheep, their fleece clotted with the stench of aviation fuel.Beside her, in profile against the fogged window, the driver's face is set. In the back seat, something dead stirs, and begins to grunt and breathe. The car flees across the junctions, and the space the road encloses is the space insideher: the arena of combat, the wasteland, the place of civil strife behind her ribs. A heart beats, taillights wink. Dim lights shine from tower blocks, from passing helicopters, from fixed stars. Night closes in on the perjured ministers and burnt-out pedophiles, on the unloved viaducts and graffitied bridges, on ditches beneath mouldering hedgerows and railings never warmed by human touch.Night and winter: but in the rotten nests and empty setts, she can feel the signs of growth, intimations of spring. This is the time of Le Pendu, the Hanged Man, swinging by his foot from the living tree. It is a time of suspension, of hesitation, of the indrawn breath. It is a time to let go of expectation, yet not abandon hope; to anticipate the turn of the Wheel of Fortune. This is our life and we have to lead it. Think of the alternative.A static cloud bank, like an ink smudge. Darkening air.It's no good asking me whether I'd choose to be like this, because I've never had a choice. I don't know about anything else. I've never been any other way.And darker still. Colour has run out from the land. Only form is left: the clumped treetops like a dragon's back. The sky deepens to midnight blue. The orange of the streetlights is blotted to a fondant cerise; in pastureland, the pylons lift their skirts in a ferrous gavotte.Copyright � 2005 by Hilary Mantel</p><h2>Briefs of Leading Cases in Law Enforcement</h2><p><p><em>Briefs of Leading Cases in Law Enforcement, Ninth Edition,</em> offers extensive updates on the leading Supreme Court cases impacting law enforcement in the United States, creating a must-have reference for police officers to stay up-to-date and have a strong understanding of the law and their function within it.

It is an excellent collection of short briefs of U.S. Supreme Court cases for law enforcement. Everything the seated and online students need to know about a case is in one or two pages. For example, <i>Tennessee v. Garner</i> is one and a half pages in the text. A typical case brief within the textbook, includes the facts of the case, issue, holding, legal reasoning, and case significance. Additionally, the authors include up-to-date cases and topics. For example, there is a new chapter on police-dog searches and a new chapter on computer crimes and cellphones as they relate to law enforcement.

A 60-page introductory essay traces the cause of women&#39;s rights from Angelina and Sarah Grimk�&#39;s campaign against slavery through the development of a full-fledged women&#39;s rights movement in the 1840s and 1850s and the emergence of race as a divisive issue that finally split that movement in 1869. A rich collection of over 50 documents includes diary entries, letters, and speeches from the Grimk�s, Maria Stewart, Lucretia Mott, Elizabeth Cady Stanton, Theodore Weld, Frances Harper, Sojourner Truth, and others, giving students immediate access to the world of abolitionists and women&#39;s right advocates and their passionate struggles for emancipation.

She has received Ford, Rockefeller, Guggenheim, and Mellon Foundation Fellowships, as well as fellowships from the National Endowment for the Humanities and the Center for Advanced Study in the Social and Behavioral Sciences.A lively anthology tracing the emergence of the women&#x2019;s-rights movement in the US during the turbulent antebellum period. Sklar (History/SUNY Binghamton) provides a lengthy introductory essay tracing with vigor and clarity the manner in which, beginning in the 1830s, white and black women in the North began to become active in the abolitionist cause, inspired in many cases by the religious revivals sweeping the nation. While women in the movement at first focused their efforts upon emancipation, the intense criticism that greeted their activities gradually pushed some of them toward an advocacy of women&#x2019;s rights as well. They discovered that they first had to defend their right to speak at all in a society in which women were expected to restrict their activities to a purely domestic sphere. At the forefront in articulating women&#x2019;s right to speak and act on moral and political issues were Angelina and Sarah Grimke, the courageous daughters of a Southern slaveowner. During their influential speaking tour in 1837, the eloquent Grimkes asserted that they pleaded &#x201c;not the cause of the slave only&#x201d; but also &#x201c;the cause of woman as a responsible moral being.&#x201d; Their lectures served both to stimulate support for the abolitionist cause and to encourage other women to begin speaking about rights and responsibilities. It also aroused discomfort among some male abolitionists, concerned that arguments over women&#x2019;s rights would diffuse moral outrage over slavery. There was, Sarah Grimke argued in a letter to a male colleague, no going back. &#x201c;To close the doors now . . . would be a violation of our fundamental principle that man and woman are created equal and have the same duties and the same responsibilities as moral beings.&#x201d; The 54 pieces collected here trace the gradual development of ideas about women&#x2019;s rights, beginning with Angelina and Sarah, the growing tension that resulted, and the articulation of a separate women&#x2019;s-rights movement in the early 1840s. The concluding section traces the gradual separation of the women&#x2019;s movement from abolitionism in the 1850s. An essential work for anyone interested in the early days of abolitionism and the women&#x2019;s movement in North America. (15 illustrations, not seen) -- <i>Copyright � 2000 Kirkus Associates, LP.

Or it might even be the hint of the quasi-classical Butterfly's Ball in the sequence of scenes showing the arrival of the insects to Nick's place to dance the night away to the tunes of the Bug-a-Wug Cricket Band. The poem's refrain tells readers that "The music is just so grand," and there's a foot-tapping beat to the variously rhymed lines that demands reading aloud to validate the claim. Phrases such as: "Slap-a-spoon drummers and the crick-crick-crickety kazoo hummers" typify the descriptive candences. Comes the dawn, all "go back with the moonlight under the hill." The paintings are not always as joyous. There is in their frequent use of shadow and silhouette a touch of the mysterious, even the sinister. In the creation of his cast of anthropomorphic critters and in setting them into melodramatic and crowded scenes, Joyce creates a benign Walpurgisnacht. One double-page spread depicts a club full of frenzied dancers that rivals one from one of the Star Wars films. With Joyce's illustrations, it's not just the music that's "so grand." --Kenneth Marantz, Art Education Department, Ohio State University, Columbus<br>Copyright 1989 Reed Business Information, Inc.The too-sweet language of this bedtime rhyme is belied by Joyce's dark and atmospheric illustrations. Every night Nicholas Cricket plays his banjo with the Bug-a-Wug Cricket Band. "Moonlight glows and summer wind blows," as "peep-peep-peepers come dancing through the vines" and "rabbits come dancing on tip-tippy toes" because "the music is just so grand." The poem's meter is annoyingly irregular--"In the blue blue night / when the moon is bright / underneath the leaves of summer, / if we're quiet and quick"--and often predictable.

Upon its initial publication in 1975, this landmark work provided fresh insight in the fields of Near Eastern Studies and Biblical Archaeology. Well-researched and cogent, Van Seters' groundbreaking analysis remains relevant and continues to inspire new research in the present. </p> <p><b>John Van Seters</b> is Professor Emeritus in the Department of Religious Studies at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill.</p> <p></p> <p>&#x201c;An important work which cannot be ignored.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x2014;<i>Journal of Biblical Literature</i></p> <p>&#x201c;The author has undertaken an objective evaluation of the more serious scholarly attempts at reconstructing the early Patriarchal Period during the past half century of archaeologically oriented research. . . . He presents a wealth of extra biblical material, in conjunction with the biblical, to determine how much of the data dealing with Abraham (and in part with Isaac) are historical and how the data in general are to be handled. . . . The study provides a badly needed whiff of fresh air in a period whose scholarly atmosphere has become stale. Three useful indexes . . . bring this volume to a close.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x2014;Harry Orlinsky, <i>JWB Circle </i></p> <p>&#x201c;Old Testament Scholars have learned to expect critical precision and provocative insight from the pen of John Van Seters. His book on the Abraham traditions meets those expectations in detail not previously available in print and this must be welcomed by all involved in Pentateuchal research.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x2014;George W.

These systems can identify at great distances approaching vehicles or scan crowds of people to pinpoint a specific individual. Once solely used by the military, they are becoming more widely used by law enforcement, business, and even high-end homeowners. This cutting-edge resource brings together the field&#39;s leading experts who guide researchers, designers, engineers, and developers through this multifaceted technology. It discusses the latest high-end sensors for extremely accurate surveillance, as well as low-cost sensing solutions.

Although she had leanings towards Homoeopathy during her student years, it was not until she visited the world-famous Dr J. T. Kent in the USA, and experienced great benefit from this therapy that she fully adopted this method of treatment in her practice. Having embarked upon a career as a Homoeopath, she studied the subject deeply and the more she learned the more she became convinced that it is the finest method of dealing with every type of ailment. Being a true healer she believed that every sufferer should know of Homoeopathy and in order to make it more widely known she wrote &#34;Homoeopathy for the First Aider&#34; which gives simple instructions for the treatment of injuries and common ailments. This book was an immediate success and she then decided to record her experiences in dealing with more serious illness and this book, &#34;The Magic of the Minimum Dose&#34; followed.</p><p>Dr Dorothy Shepherd was a convert to Homoeopathy in the early days of her medical career and until her death she had a large practice in Harley Street and a Nursing Home in Hampshire. She was an ardent follower of Hahnemann&#39;s teaching.</p><h2>The Sexual Life of Catherine M.</h2><p>A national best-seller that was featured on such lists as The New York Times, the Los Angeles Times, The Washington Post, the San Francisco Chronicle, The Boston Globe, and Publishers Weekly, The Sexual Life of Catherine M. was the controversial sleeper hit of the year. Since her youth, Catherine Millet, the eminent editor of Art Press, has led an extraordinarily active and free sexual life -- from al fresco encounters in Italy to a gang bang on the edge of the Bois du Boulogne to a high-class orgy at a chichi Parisian restaurant. A graphic account of sex stripped of sentiment, of a life of physical gratification and a relentlessly honest look at the consequences -- both liberating and otherwise -- have created this candid, powerful, and deeply intelligent depiction of unfettered sexuality.</p><p>Catherine Millet is editor of the prestigious French art magazine Art Press. She is also the author of eight books of art criticism, including Yves Klein, Le critique d&#39;art s&#39;expose, and L&#39;art contemporain en France. She lives in Paris with her husband.Millet, art critic and editor of Art Press, has become a literary sensation in France with the publication of this graphic memoir of some 30 years of her sexual adventures. Millet's "gift for observation" and her "solid superego" are as useful in her career as an art critic as they are in her erotic explorations: her ability to concentrate and observe puts her inside "other people's skins." Comparisons have been made to The Story Of O, but Millet is more in the tradition of Jean Genet and Violette Leduc, whose descriptions of their sexual encounters were not meant to titillate so much as to explore the meaning of the erotic. Millet's "quest for the sexual grail" takes her to group orgies, gang bangs in French parks and other serial sex escapades. Before long, the sex begins to seem utterly routine, in spite of the elaborate staging. Millet and her readers are then free to consider more closely some questions she raises: how oral sex compares to vaginal intercourse; why sex in disgusting circumstances is not about "self-abasement," but raising oneself "above all prejudice"; or why solitary sex is more pleasurable for her than sex with a partner. Toward the end of this curiously graceful memoir, Millet comes close to explaining her need for all this sex: only by sloughing off the "mechanical body" she'd been born with could she experience actual sexual pleasure. While women readers will find much of interest, male readers may have to overcome a certain emperor's new clothes-type discomfort, as they realize that Millet may know more about the male body than they do. <br>Copyright 2002 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>How College Works</h2><p><p>Constrained by shrinking budgets, can colleges do more to improve the quality of education? And can students get more out of college without paying higher tuition? Daniel Chambliss and Christopher Takacs conclude that the limited resources of colleges and students need not diminish the undergraduate experience. <i>How College Works</i> reveals the surprisingly decisive role that personal relationships play in determining a student's collegiate success, and puts forward a set of small, inexpensive interventions that yield substantial improvements in educational outcomes.</p><p>At a liberal arts college in New York, the authors followed a cluster of nearly one hundred students over a span of eight years. The curricular and technological innovations beloved by administrators mattered much less than the professors and peers whom students met, especially early on. At every turning point in students' undergraduate lives, it was the people, not the programs, that proved critical. Great teachers were more important than the topics studied, and even a small number of good friendships--two or three--made a significant difference academically as well as socially.</p><p>For most students, college works best when it provides the daily motivation to learn, not just access to information. Improving higher education means focusing on the quality of a student's relationships with mentors and classmates, for when students form the right bonds, they make the most of their education.</p></p><p><p>Daniel F. Chambliss is Eugene M. Tobin Distinguished Professor of Sociology at Hamilton College.</p><p>Christopher G. Takacs is a Ph.D. candidate in sociology at the University of Chicago.</p>&#x201c;The book shares the narrative of the student experience, what <i>happens </i>to students as they move through their educations, all the way from arrival to graduation. This is an important distinction. [Chambliss and Takacs] do not try to measure what students have learned, but what it is like to live through college, and what those experiences mean both during the time at school, as well as going forward.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>John Warner</b><b>, </b><b><i>Inside Higher Ed</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;There is a lot to like about <i>How College Works</i>.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Mary Taylor Huber</b><b>, </b><b><i>Change</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;<i>How College Works </i>is a wonderful book&#x2015;both rigorous and a pleasure to read.

The author offers detailed accounts of how killers travel a path that leads from childhood innocence to lethal violence in adolescence or adulthood. He places the emotional and moral damage of each individual killer within a larger scientific framework of social, psychological, anthropological, and biological research on human development.

Like volume one, it is based on the new version of Napoleon&#x2019;s correspondence, made available by the Fondation Napol�on in Paris. It is the story of Napoleon&#x2019;s conquest of Europe&#x2015;and that of his magnificent Grande Arm�e&#x2015; as they sweep through the length and breadth of Europe.<br><br> Spirit of the Age opens with Napoleon&#x2019;s as yet untested army making its way through the Bavarian Alps in the early winter of 1805, to fall upon the unsuspecting Austrians and Russians, and crushing them at Austerlitz. This was only the beginning of series of spectacular victories: over the Prussians in 1806, and then the Russians, which brought the Tsar to defeat in 1807. It follows the army into Spain, in 1808, most ill-considered step in his career as ruler, and then through the most daunting triumph of all, the final defeat of Austria at Wagram, in 1809, the bloodiest battle in European history up to that time.<br><br> These five years encompass the dramas of Napoleon&#x2019;s separation from Josephine amid the turmoil of ruling a pan-European empire. These years also saw Napoleon navigate plots against him, his clash with the Pope and excommunication, and his loss of trust in many of those closest to him. It closes with his marriage to Marie-Louise, the daughter of his defeated enemy, the Emperor of Austria. With the greatest "trophy bride&#x201d; in history on his arm, Napoleon now turns again to face his only remaining enemy, Britain, and the challenge of ruling an empire that now spans the entirety of Europe. 16 pages of color and B&amp;W illustrations</p><p><strong>Michael Broers</strong> is a professor of Western European history at Oxford University.

Stephen, the king's page, is summoned to identify a sad, lone figure in the town square. He recognizes the man to be a poor farmer who often comes into town "looking for things . . . firewood . . . and scraps from the kitchen." For reasons Stephen cannot understand, King Wenceslas bids the boy load up on supplies, and they set off in a blinding snowstorm to deliver the food and wood to the man's family. When they arrive at the house, Stephen enjoys a warm--and warmhearted--feast. Richardson tells her story in a straightforward and ingratiating manner, wisely avoiding any exaggeration of the carol's events. Englander's rousing illustrations, full of rich hues of gold and red, perfectly capture the gusto of the holiday season. The carol appears in full on the attractive endpapers, inviting readers to delve into the pages within. Ages 4-8. <br>Copyright 1991 Reed Business Information, Inc.The carol about ``Good King Wenceslas'' is expanded into a sentimental story in which a rather thoughtless young page is taken along to see how the less fortunate live; the bounty he and his king take to the humble cottage is shared in a sumptuous feast after the king himself builds up the fire. The telling is adequate if prosaic; it does serve to explicate John Mason Neale's verse, which younger children may find obscure. Englander's attractive illustrations set the story appropriately in medieval Eastern Europe; the page (also named Stephen--it's his birthday as well as the saint's day) looks like an appealing blond member of a modern third grade, while the grandly clothed king is thoughtful and suitably benign. Not essential, but enjoyable. (Picture book. 4-8) -- <i>Copyright �1991, Kirkus Associates, LP.

There is relief in hearing the expressions of desperation in the psalmist&#x2019;s voice. He didn&#x2019;t experience this life perfected, and we don&#x2019;t either. But the psalmist was loved. So are we.<br><br>God was so kind to give us the Psalms.<br><br>To walk through darkened days is part of the human experience. To walk through them with faith, comfort, strength, joy, and hope is part of the divine experience. Our eyes, though, are often clouded to those blessings by the thing oppressing us. When we remember and recognize our Father&#x2019;s faithfulness, when we see reality with the eyes of understanding, the darkness ebbs and the light of hope grows. The impossible, unbearable, and unthinkable becomes the hidden passageway to truth, hope, and joy in Christ.<br><br>These letters were originally written as encouragement to a friend when the darkness began to overtake his path. Each day for 22 days, a letter arrived with one of the eight-verse sections from Psalm 119 along with a small thought to bring light and hope and to be a reminder that we do not fight our battles alone. The letters, along with nine more devotions on the subject of experiencing God in the dark, make up this powerful, honest, hope-filled 31-day devotional.</p><p><b>You are never alone.</b><br>Our Father shines his light in the darkness of this world, and nothing&#x2015;no adversary, no lie, no doubt or discouragement&#x2015;can extinguish that light.

She encourages us to spend a lot of time outdoors, immersed in nature and handling natural objects and collecting experiences on which to base the rest of their education. She discusses the use of training in good habits such as attention, thinking, imagining, remembering, performing tasks with perfect execution, obedience, and truthfulness, to replace undesirable tendencies in children (and the adults that they grow into). She details how lessons in various school subjects can be done using her approach. She concludes with remarks about the Will, the Conscience, and the Divine Life in the Child. Charlotte Mason was a late nineteenth-century British educator whose ideas were far ahead of her time. She believed that children are born persons worthy of respect, rather than blank slates, and that it was better to feed their growing minds with living literature and vital ideas and knowledge, rather than dry facts and knowledge filtered and pre-digested by the teacher. Her method of education, still used by some private schools and many homeschooling families, is gentle and flexible, especially with younger children, and includes first-hand exposure to great and noble ideas through books in each school subject, conveying wonder and arousing curiosity, and through reflection upon great art, music, and poetry; nature observation as the primary means of early science teaching; use of manipulatives and real-life application to understand mathematical concepts and learning to reason, rather than rote memorization and working endless sums; and an emphasis on character and on cultivating and maintaining good personal habits. Schooling is teacher-directed, not child-led, but school time should be short enough to allow students free time to play and to pursue their own worthy interests such as handicrafts.

McGraw, one of Oprah's favorite sidekicks and host of his own television show, promises that you will succeed with his methods, because you will change "from the inside out." McGraw's 7 Keys are sound--not quick. First, you have to understand and face your "personal truth"--what you think about yourself and your weight--and replace toxic messages with positive thoughts. Next, step by step, you learn how to counter emotional eating, change your environment, master impulse eating, choose foods, adopt an exercise habit, and assemble a support circle. Each step is clearly explained and personalized with case studies, fill-in charts, and self-tests. His nutrition plan emphasizes foods with high nutritional yields for few calories, and that cannot be eaten quickly (generally because they're high in fiber), so you're less likely to overeat. McGraw is the author of <i>Life Strategies</i>, <i>Relationship Rescue</i>, and <i>Self Matters</i>. Here he offers his unique, , tell-it-like-it-is, take-no-prisoners style to help you change "what you eat, why you eat, where you eat, when you eat, and how you eat," all in an individualized approach that's bound to be effective.

The life of Booker T. Washington embodied the legendary rise of an American self-made man, and his autobiography gave voice for the first time to a vast group that had to pull itself up from nothing. In the well-documented ordeals and observations of this humble and plainspoken schoolmaster we find traces of Washington's other nature: the ambitious and tough-minded analyst. Here was a man who had to balance the demands of his fellow blacks with the constraints imposed on him by whites.</p><p>Nineteenth-century African American businessman, activist, and educator Booker Taliaferro Washington's <i>Up from Slavery</i> is one of the greatest American autobiographies ever written. Its mantras of black economic empowerment, land ownership, and self-help inspired generations of black leaders, including Marcus Garvey, Elijah Muhammad, Malcolm X, and Louis Farrakhan. In rags-to-riches fashion, Washington recounts his ascendance from early life as a mulatto slave in Virginia to a 34-year term as president of the influential, agriculturally based Tuskegee Institute in Alabama. From that position, Washington reigned as the most important leader of his people, with slogans like "cast down your buckets," which emphasized vocational merit rather than the academic and political excellence championed by his contemporary rival W.E.B. Du Bois. Though many considered him too accommodating to segregationists, Washington, as he said in his historic "Atlanta Compromise" speech of 1895, believed that "political agitation alone would not save [the Negro]," and that "property, industry, skill, intelligence, and character" would prove necessary to black Americans' success. The potency of his philosophies are alive today in the nationalist and conservative camps that compose the complex quilt of black American society.This book is in Electronic Paperback Format.

Determined to speak out more actively for both Holocaust survivors and the disenfranchised everywhere, he sets himself a challenge: "I will become militant. I will teach, share, bear witness. I will reveal and try to mitigate the victims' solitude." He makes words his weapon, and in these pages we relive with him his unstinting battles.<br><br>We see him meet with world leaders and travel to regions ruled by war, dictatorship, racism, and exclusion in order to engage the most pressing issues of the day. We see him in the Soviet Union defending persecuted Jews and dissidents; in South Africa battling apartheid and supporting Mandela's ascension; in Cambodia and in Bosnia, calling on the world to face the atrocities; in refugee camps in Albania and Macedonia as an emissary for President Clinton.<br><br>He chastises Ronald Reagan for his visit to the German military cemetery at Bitburg. He supports Lech Walesa but challenges some of his views. He confronts Francois Mitterrand over the misrepresentation of his activities in Vichy France. He does battle with Holocaust deniers. He joins tens of thousands of young Austrians demonstrating against renascent fascism in their country. He receives the Nobel Peace Prize.<br><br>Through it all, Wiesel remains deeply involved with his beloved Israel, its leaders and its people, and laments its internal conflicts. He recounts the behind-the-scenes events that led to the establishment of the Holocaust Museum in Washington, D.C. He shares the feelings evoked by his return to Auschwitz, by his recollections of Yitzhak Rabin, and by his memories of his own vanished family.<br><br>This is the magnificent finale of a historic memoir.</p><p><i>And the Sea Is Never Full</i> is Elie Wiesel's memoir of the period between 1969 and the present. Wiesel, an esteemed writer (his <i>Night</i> is among the greatest memoirs of the Holocaust) and political activist, begins the book remembering a challenge given to himself at age 40: "I will become militant. I will teach, share, bear witness. I will reveal and try to mitigate the victims' solitude." He defends dissidents in the Soviet Union; draws attention to the atrocities of Cambodia and Bosnia; and fights apartheid in South Africa. He attacks Holocaust deniers, stands with Lech Walesa in Poland, visits Albania as a representative of President Clinton, and wins the Nobel Peace Prize. Wiesel's tragic boyhood compelled him to work very hard to love the world. He has learned to do so, and this memoir, like all of his best writing, teaches its reader to love the world while looking directly at its greatest terrors. <i>--Michael Joseph Gross</i>In praise of Elie Wiesel's All Rivers Run to the Sea <br><br>"Part of the delight of All Rivers lies in witnessing the gradual transformation of the brokenhearted, orphaned young boy into the spirited journalist who longs to embrace the world at large, and who, in time, does." --Rebecca Goldstein, Newsday <br><br>"Immensely moving [and] unforgettable, [with] the searing intensity of his novels and autobiographical tales . . . Will make you cry, yet somehow leaves you renewed, with a cautious hope for humanity's future." --Publishers Weekly<br><br> "This is Elie Wiesel at his best, a highly revealing self-portrait of the man behind the world-famed persona." --Herman Wouk<br><br> "Remarkable . . . Wiesel writes with poetic beauty and heart-stopping eloquence." --Susan Miron, Miami Herald <br><br>"A biblical-like epic of a great man who has turned genocidal tragedy into a life force for world peace. It should be required reading." --Alan M. Dershowitz<br><br>"For all those who have never known Elie Wiesel, these memoirs are an introduction to the man, and for many who have met him, there will be discoveries and realizations." --Raul Hilberg, Boston Globe</p><h2>I Am Different from You: How Children Experience Themselves and the World in the Middle of Childhood</h2><p>In many of his lectures to teachers on education, Rudolf Steiner called attention to a significant but often overlooked change in the way children experience themselves and the world that occurs in the middle of childhood, in the ninth or tenth year. <br><br>&#x201c;There comes a time when children show, not in what they say but in their whole behavior, that they are struggling with a question or a number of questions that indicates a crisis in their soul life. It is a very subtle experience for the child that requires an equally subtle response.&#x201d; <br><br>In this deep and concise book, Peter Selg illuminates this momentous phenomenon in child development, this &#x201c;dramatic change&#x201d; in the child&#x2019;s consciousness. Though it is &#x201c;hardly noticeable&#x201d; to the observer, Steiner reveals that children during this time in life experience a sudden inner instability, a loss of the foundation they felt had been naturally supporting and carrying them. It is a crisis that pediatric psychologists and psychiatrists know well, as many fears and weaknesses that rise to the surface later, in adolescence, can be traced back to this subtle event. Parents and educators need to know what to say and how to act, because their response at this time will be crucial for the child&#x2019;s entire life. Through Steiner&#x2019;s profound wisdom of children's inner essence, adults can learn to give them the experience of being carried by a strong and sure relationship: <br><br>"When children cross the Rubicon between the ninth and tenth year without that feeling, something will be lacking in their later life, and they will have to struggle to attain what they should have received naturally at that moment in childhood."<br><br><i>I Am Different from You</i> is a vital book for all parents and teachers to read&#x2015;well before the crisis in the middle of childhood&#x2015;to recognize what is necessary to support children during this decisive event in the right way.</p><p><b>Peter Selg</b> was born in 1963 in Stuttgart and studied medicine in Witten-Herdecke, Zurich, and Berlin.

It presents a vast range of woodlore in the most palatable of forms, a genuinely delightful story. It will provide many hours of good reading for any child who likes the out-of-doors, and will teach him or her many interesting facts of nature, as well as a number of practical skills. It will be sure to awaken an interest in the outdoor world in any youngster who has not yet discovered the fascination of nature.<br>The story concerns two farm boys who build a teepee in the woods and persuade the grownups to let them live in it for a month. During that time they learn to prepare their own food, build a fire without matches, use an axe expertly, make a bed out of boughs; they learn how to "smudge" mosquitoes, how to get clear water from a muddy pond, how to build a dam, how to know the stars, how to find their way when they get lost; how to tell the direction of the wind, blaze a trail, distinguish animal tracks, protect themselves from wild animals; how to use Indian signals, make moccasins, bows and arrows, Indian drums and war bonnets; how to know the trees and plants, and how to make dyes from plants and herbs. They learn all about the habits of various birds and animals, how they get their food, who their enemies are and how they protect themselves from them.<br>Most of this information is not generally available in books, and could be gained otherwise only by years of life and experience in suitable surroundings. Yet Mr. Thompson Seton explains it so vividly and fully, with so many clear, marginal illustrations through the book, that the reader will finish "Two Little Savages" with an enviable knowledge of trees, plants, wild-life, woodlore, Indian crafts and arts, and survival information for the wilds. All of this is presented through a lively narrative that has as its heroes two real boys, typically curious about everything in the world around them, eager to outdo each other in every kind of endeavor. The exciting adventures that befall them during their stay in the woods are just the sort of thing that will keep a young reader enthralled and will stimulate his or her imagination at every turn.</p><p></p></p><p>Ernest Thompson Seton (1860 1946) was a British-born author, wildlife artist, cofounder of the Boy Scouts of America, and an early pioneer of the modern school of animal fiction writing whose best-known book is &#34;Wild Animals I Have Known.&#34;</p><h2>The New Oxford Picture Dictionary (English/Vietnamese Edition) (English and Vietnamese Edition)</h2><p>Published in 1988, this dictionary continues to be a favorite of many teachers.<br></p><p>Text: English, Vietnamese</p><h2>The New Humanities Reader</h2><p>THE NEW HUMANITIES READER presents 25 challenging and important essays from diverse fields that address current global issues.

His father, a poor barber-surgeon, wandered up and down Spain in search of work. Educated as a child by the Jesuits in Seville, the creator of <b>Don Quixote</b> grew up to follow the career of a professional soldier. He was wounded at Lepanto in 1571, captured by the Turks in 1575, imprisoned for five years, and was finally rescued by the Trinitarian friars in 1580. On his return to Spain he found his family more impoverished than ever before. Supporting his mother, two sisters, and an illegitimate daughter, he settled down to a literary career and had hopes of becoming a successful playwright, but just then the youthful <b>Lope de Vega</b> entered triumphantly to transform the Spanish theatre by his genius. <b>Galatea</b>, a pastoral romance, was published in 1585, the year of Cervantes&#x2019; marriage to <b>Catalina de Palacios y Salazar Vozmediano</b>. But it did not bring him an escape from poverty, and he was forced to become a roving commissary for the Spanish armada. This venture, which led to bankruptcy and jail, lasted for fifteen years. Although he never knew prosperity, Cervantes did gain a measure of fame during his lifetime, and Don Quixote and Sancho Panza were known all over the world. Part I of Don Quixote was published in 1605; in 1613, his <b>Exemplary Novels</b> appeared, and these picaresque tales of romantic adventure gained immediate popularity. <b>Journey to Parnassas</b>, a satirical review of his fellow Spanish poets, appeared in 1614, and Part II of Don Quixote in 1615 as well as <b>Eight Plays and Eight Interludes</b>. Miguel de Cervantes died on April 23, 1616, the same day as the death of Shakespeare--his English contemporary, his only peer.&#x201c;What a unique monument is this book!...How its creative genius, critical, free and human, soars above its age!&#x201d;&#x2014;Thomas Mann</p><h2>Mindful Universe: Quantum Mechanics and the Participating Observer (The Frontiers Collection)</h2><p>The classical mechanistic idea of nature that prevailed during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries was essentially mindless: the physically described aspects of nature were asserted to be completely determined by prior physically described aspects alone, with conscious experiences entering only passively. In the last century these classical concepts were found inadequate. In the new quantum mechanics theory, conscious experiences enter into the dynamics in specified ways not fixed by physically described aspects alone.</p><p>The classical mechanistic idea of nature that prevailed in science during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries was an essentially mindless conception: the&nbsp;physically described&nbsp;aspects of nature were asserted to be completely determined by prior physically described aspects alone, with our conscious experiences entering only passively. During the twentieth century the classical concepts were found to be inadequate. In the new theory, quantum mechanics, our conscious experiences enter into the dynamics in specified ways not fixed by the physically described aspects alone. Consequences of this radical change in our understanding of the connection between mind and brain are described. "Stapp's book is a bold and original attack on the problem of consciousness and free will based on the openings provided by the laws of quantum mechanics. This is a serious and interesting attack on a truly fundamental problem." Tony Leggett [Physics Nobel Laureate, 2003]&nbsp; "Stapp's wide-ranging proposal offers stimulating reading, a strong sense of conceptual coherence and intuitive appeal, and empirical predictions that deserve to be refined and tested." Harald Atmanspacher "A highly readable book of genuine wisdom by one of the foremost minds for our generation." Allan CombsAuthor of over three hundred research papers on the mathematical, physical, and philosophical foundations of quantum mechanics, and a Springer book "Mind, matter, and quantum mechanics". Worked personally with W. Heisenberg, W. Pauli, and J.A. Wheeler on these issues. Invited author of entries about quantum theories consciousness in several currently about to appear encyclopedias. Invited plenary speaker at numerous international conferences. &nbsp; For book cover: Henry Stapp has spent his entire career working in frontier areas of theoretical physics. After completing his thesis work under Nobel Laureates Emilio Segr� and Owen Chamberlain, he joined Wolfgang Pauli to tackle foundational issues. After Pauli's early death, he turned to von Neumann's ideas about the mathematical foundations of quantum theory. The essay 'Mind, Matter and Quantum Mechanics', that developed out of this work eventually evolved into Stapp's classic book bearing the same title. His deep interest in the quantum measurement problem led him to pursue extensive work pertaining to the influence of our conscious thoughts on physical processes occurring in our brains. The understandings achieved in this work have been described in many technical articles and now, in more accessible prose, in the present book.</p><h2>Becoming More Than a Good Bible Study Girl</h2><p><p><strong>Is something missing in your life?</strong></p><p>Lysa TerKeurst knows what it&#x2019;s like to consider God just another thing on her to-do list.

In <em>Crowns of Glory</em>, Emilia Viotti da Costa tells the riveting story of this pivotal moment in the history of slavery. Studying the complaints brought by slaves to the office of the Protector of Slaves, she reconstructs the experience of slavery through the eyes of the Demerara slaves themselves. Da Costa also draws on eyewitness accounts, official records, and private journals (most notably the diary of John Smith, one of four ministers sent by the London Missionary Society to convert Demerara's "heathen"), to paint a vivid portrait of a society in transition, shaken to its foundations by the recent revolutions in America, France, and Haiti. Casting new light on the nuances of racial relations in the colonies, the inevitable clash between the missionaries' message of Christian brotherhood and a social order based on masters and slaves, and the larger historical forces that were profoundly eroding the institution of slavery itself, <em>Crowns of Glory</em> is an original and unforgettable book.<br></p><p><br>A native of Brazil, <strong>Emilia Viotti da Costa</strong> is Professor of History at Yale University, and the author of <em>The Brazilian Empire: Myths and Histories</em>.<br><br>"A riveting drama and a magnificent historical tract."--<em>Booklist</em><p></p><br>"A riveting account of the rebellion that gave new urgency to the British Anti-Slavery Movement."--<em>Quarterly Black Review</em><p></p><br>"Extraodinarily moving and analytically nuanced....This book certainly represents an impressively significant contribution to the historiography....Among the outstanding achievements of this work is its common accessibility to specialists across a variety of disciplines as well as the general reader. Eminently readable and solidly researched, this work deftly explores the multifaceted links between individuals and groups, colony and metropolis, and divergent views of the world."--<em>American Historical Review</em><p></p><br>"A first-rate account of a little-known episode that had large consequences for Britain and for the world: careful, professional scholarship married to a well-told story."--<em>Kirkus Reviews</em><p></p><br>"Da Costa triangulates brilliantly between the worlds of the slaves, the slave owners, and the missionaries to bring alive the irony and tragedy of this great rebellion. I know of no other study that goes so searchingly and movingly to the ideological heart of a slave revolt."--James C. Scott, author of <em>Weapons of the Weak: Everyday Forms of Peasant Resistance</em><p></p><br>"With thorough, judicious research, Yale history professor da Costa reconstructs one of the greatest slave uprisings...of the New World.'"--<em>Publishers Weekly</em><p></p><br>"In a narrative of extraordinary depth, da Costa has not simply recounted the horrors exposed in a major slave revolt and its suppression, she has used the revolt to explore the complex web of human relations, the hopes and fears, the hatred and compassion, that lie beneath the formal structure and outward activities of every society."--Edmund S. Morgan, author of <em>American Slavery, American Freedom</em> and <em>The Challenge of the American Revolution</em><p></p><br>"[Viotti da Costa] has made effective use both of the background material and of a considerable mass of both primary and secondary sources....This book is a skillful representation of an important episode into which many attitudes and strands of feeling and their interaction were woven."--<em>Labor</em> <em>History</em><p></p><br></p><h2>Fruits of the Earth</h2><p>During the author&#39;s travels, he meets Menalcas, a caricature of Oscar Wilde, who relates his fantastic life story. But for all his brilliance, Menalcas is only Gide&#39;s yesterday self, a discarded wraith who leaves Gide free to stop exalting the ego and embrace bodily and spiritual joy. Later Fruits of the Earth, written in 1935 during Gide&#39;s short-lived spell of communism, reaffirms the doctrine of the earlier book. But now he sees happiness not as freedom, but a submission to heroism. In a series of &#39;Encounters&#39;, Gide describes a Negro tramp, a drowned child, a lunatic and other casualties of life. These reconcile him to suffering, death and religion, causing him to insist that &#39;today&#39;s Utopia&#39; be &#39;tomorrow&#39;s reality&#39;.</p><p></p><h2>iPhone For Seniors For Dummies (For Dummies (Computer/Tech))</h2><p><b>A larger-print, graphic-rich guide to everything iPhone has to offer!</b> <p><i>iPhone For Seniors For Dummies</i> is the complete guide to getting the most out of your iPhone 6 or higher.

In the first centuries the arts flourished and developed in the independent states and principalities, but gradually native schools in centres like Novgorod and Kiev gave way to centralization based on Moscow. From the emergence of Russia under Peter the Great until the late 19th century, specifically Russian qualities gave way to Western European inspiration and advice. However, as the 19th century developed, there was a reaction from foreign domination and this led to the rediscovery of native traditions.</p><p></p><h2>Integrated Electronics: Analog and Digital Circuits and Systems</h2><p>Nearly all major semiconductor devices are examined for internal behavior, external variables, analog and digital applications, and uses in smalland large-signal model and integrated-circuit construction</p><p></p><h2>The Bakelite Jewelry Book</h2><p>Presents a collection of the finest pieces of Bakelite jewelry, discussing its popularity during the Depression era and tracing its increasing popularity among collectors</p><p></p><h2>The Student&#39;s Guide to Social Neuroscience</h2><p><p>Social neuroscience is a rapidly growing field which explains, using neural mechanisms, our ability to recognize, understand, and interact with others.

The Art of the Kitchen Garden, in glorious full color, makes it easy for anyone with an interest in gardening and fresh produce to enjoy a beautiful and productive kitchen garden. This elegant book celebrates the old world traditions of designing and planting a garden by emphasizing artistic design, dazzling color arrays, and the details that make each garden unique. Vivid photos and detailed color illustrations help even those with little experience succeed at kitchen gardening. The book includes helpful instructions for creating and maintaining a personalized kitchen garden, proven guidance for selecting the best plants, and expert advice for combining color, texture, and height for delightful results. It&#39;s a stunning and informative read for gardeners who grow either ornamentals or vegetables.</p><p>Gertley is the founder of Second Bloom Botanicals, a company specializing in dried flowers.The difference between vegetable gardens and kitchen gardens, writes Turner in her introduction to Kitchen Gardens, is that "a kitchen garden has style." No more straight boring rows of vegetables: culinary gardens can now be made in a variety of styles and laid out in intricate patterns that include plenty of flowers among the edibles. Recognized garden writers address this style in 17 chapters: Suzy Bales on kitchen gardens in bloom, Renee Shepherd on essential vegetable plants, Cathy Barash on kitchen gardening in the Northeast, and so on. Grouped by theme (design, basic techniques, plant material, region), these short essays provide the inspiration and basic information to get any gardener started. The Gertleys' book concentrates on just one of the possible design styles for a kitchen garden, based on the parterre de broderie, which achieved its ultimate glory at Versailles. Beginning with simple geometric shapes, their designs become increasingly complex as they use Celtic knots, Japanese crests, and quilt patterns as their inspiration. These gardens demand much of their creators, as they must be meticulously laid out, carefully groomed, and even harvested with care in order not to destroy the patterns made by the vegetables. Unfortunately the diagrams for the various garden layouts are hard to decipher, putting an unnecessary burden on the gardener. A better volume to follow up on the ideas of Kitchen Gardens is Susan McClure's Culinary Gardens (LJ 10/1/97).

What I didn't expect, as I turned the pages, was that these images and words would accrue to yield such an intimate portrait of 18th century life. Herein I learned that George Washington preferred breakfasts of Indian hoecakes smeared with butter and honey, and that Martha Washington loved artichokes to distraction. By telling stories about how and what the Washington family cooked, and how they entertained, Stephen McLeod and his colleagues have sketched a compelling portrait of nascent American culinary identity."--John T.

M has moved north now, from a life of kitchens and trailer parks, to that of Civil War re-enactor at a run-down living history park in the dying blue-collar rustbelt of central Pennsylvania. Though he dies now, in uniform, on a regular basis, M's world, his daily struggles, remain unchanged. Isolation. Loneliness. Other-ness. Shepherded, cared for by the Guptas (the immigrant family who runs the motel where he lives, outsiders in their own right) and tolerated by his neighbors, by most of his coworkers at Old Scald Village, but tormented by a few, M wants only to find love and understanding. The serendipitous arrival of Holly and her damaged brother, halted on their own journey of loss, stirs hope in the Minotaur&#x2019;s life. As their paths overlap we find ourselves rooting for the old bull as he stumbles toward a real live human relationship.</p> <p>Steven Sherrill is a graduate of UNC Charlotte and holds an MFA in poetry from the Iowa Writers&#x2019; Workshop. The recipient of a NEA Fellowship for Fiction, he has published four novels and one book of poetry.

M has a silent film&#x2019;s starring role in the midst of a �country-and-western talkie. Precisely by limiting the beast to deeds, not speech, the writer eventually creates&#x2015;against all odds&#x2015;a living hybridized contradiction.

Seeming to have come out of nowhere to dominate the discussion-from permaculture to renewable energy to the local food movement-the ideas that underlie and define sustainability can be traced back several centuries.<br><br>In this illuminating and fascinating primer, Jeremy L. Caradonna does just that, approaching sustainability from a historical perspective and revealing the conditions that gave it shape. Locating the underpinnings of the movement as far back as the 1660s, Caradonna considers the origins of sustainability across many fields throughout Europe and North America. Taking us from the emergence of thoughts guiding sustainable yield forestry in the late 17th and 18th centuries, through the challenges of the Industrial Revolution, the birth of the environmental movement, and the emergence of a concrete effort to promote a balanced approach to development in the latter half of the 20th century, he shows that while sustainability draws upon ideas of social justice, ecological economics, and environmental conservation, it is more than the sum of its parts and blends these ideas together into a dynamic philosophy. <br><br>Caradonna's book broadens our understanding of what "sustainability" means, revealing how it progressed from a relatively marginal concept to an ideal that shapes everything from individual lifestyles, government and corporate strategies, and even national and international policy. For anyone seeking understand the history of those striving to make the world a better place to live, here's a place to start.<br></p><p><br>Jeremy L.

Few scholars have seriously studied the subject, and until now none have satisfactorily explained the origins of the tradition or elucidated how its conventions reflected class structure and gender roles. Gary P. Leupp fills the gap with a dynamic examination of the origins and nature of the tradition. Based on a wealth of literary and historical documentation, this study places Tokugawa homosexuality in a global context, exploring its implications for contemporary debates on the historical construction of sexual desire.<br><br>Combing through popular fiction, law codes, religious works, medical treatises, biographical material, and artistic treatments, Leupp traces the origins of pre-Tokugawa homosexual traditions among monks and samurai, then describes the emergence of homosexual practices among commoners in Tokugawa cities. He argues that it was "nurture" rather than "nature" that accounted for such conspicuous male/male sexuality and that bisexuality was more prevalent than homosexuality. Detailed, thorough, and very readable, this study is the first in English or Japanese to address so comprehensively one of the most complex and intriguing aspects of Japanese history.</p><p>"An invaluable resource for anyone seeking a history of the representation of homosexuality in Japan."&#x2015;Sandra Buckley, author of <i>Broken Silence: Voices of Japanese Feminism</i><br><br>"Opens a window on the complex and varied patterns of sexual relations between males in early modern Japan. Imperative reading for anyone concerned with human sexual expression in social context."&#x2015;David F. Greenberg, author of <i>The Construction of Homosexuality</i><br><br>"<i>Nanshoku</i>&#x2015;male colors&#x2015;as male same-sex eroticism and sexuality were known in early modern Japan, enjoyed an honored place in the life and mythology of the age, celebrated in art and literature with as much energy and enthusiasm as male-female eroticism. Unfettered by the moral opporbium that constrained&#x2015;or concealed&#x2015;male-male eroticism in Europe, male colors flew brightly in the public culture of urban Japan. Gary Leupp explores the practices and the cultural celebration of the Edo-era nanshoku tradition in this exuberant, sensitive, and yet dispassionate social and cultural history of male homoeroticism, the best modern scholarly study in English to date. Leupp ranges widely in a vast array of original literary, dramatic, and visual sources, which he brings to life with a finely textured use of comparative material from other traditions of male-male love both in East Asia and across the premodern world. Highly original and insightful, it will be standard reading for years to come."&#x2015;Ronald P.

He traveled to Black Africa twice. He reported about the wealthy, multi-cultural trading centers at the African East coast, such as Mombasa and Kilwa, and the warm hospitality he experienced in Mogadishu. <p>He also visited the court of Mansa Musa and neighboring states during its period of prosperity from mining and the trans-Saharan trade. He wrote disapprovingly of sexual integration in families and of a "hostility toward the white man." Ibn Battuta's description is a unique document of the high culture, pride, and independence of Black African states in the fourteenth century. </p><p>This book is one of the most important documents about Black Africa written by a non-European Medieval historian. </p><p>The new appendixes include reports by contemporary Arab travelers who witnessed events described by Ibn Battuta, such as Ibn Khaldun, al-Maqqari, Ibn al-Dawadari and Al-Maqrizi.</p></p><p>Everybody knows the names of European explorers such as Marco Polo and Christopher Columbus, but how many have heard of Ibn Battuta? This intrepid North African scholar first set out for Mecca in the year 1325 A.D. and became so smitten with life on the road that he just kept traveling for the next 29 years. Though Mecca was the object of most of his journeys, Ibn Battuta took different routes each time and thus managed to visit such far-flung places as the Maldive Islands, northern Turkey, and southern China. Ibn Battuta twice traveled south of the Sahara, once visiting the coast of East Africa during a voyage back to Morocco from Arabia, and once journeying to Mali by camel caravan--his last recorded adventure. As with all his journeys, Ibn Battuta kept a detailed account of the places he visited and the people he met. In <i>Ibn Battuta in Black Africa</i>, editors Noel King and Said Hamdun have selected and translated many of Ibn Battuta's writings about his travels in Africa. Anyone interested in the precolonial cultures that thrived in sub-Saharan Africa will find this highly personal account of the private lives and public institutions of the peoples of 14th-century East and West Africa fascinating reading.Ibn Battuta (1304-1377) was one of the first great travellers in world history - a century before Marco Polo. He was a scholar of Islamic law and found employment all over the Muslim world as a traveling judge or advisor to the rulers. He travelled to medieval Ghana, Mecca, India, and China and wrote his travel stories after his return to his native Tangier, Morocco, which were widely translated numerous times from Arabic.</p><h2>High-Performance Computer Architecture (Addison-Wesley Series in Electrical and Computer Engineering)</h2><p>This update of the popular book on computer architecture presents design ideas embodied in many high-performance machines and stresses techniques for evaluating them.

How much does it influence our children? More than we wish to believe. While it has been argued that rigid class structures have eroded in favor of greater social equality, <i>The Son Also Rises</i> proves that movement on the social ladder has changed little over eight centuries. Using a novel technique&#x2015;tracking family names over generations to measure social mobility across countries and periods&#x2015;renowned economic historian Gregory Clark reveals that mobility rates are lower than conventionally estimated, do not vary across societies, and are resistant to social policies.</p><p>Clark examines and compares surnames in such diverse cases as modern Sweden and Qing Dynasty China. He demonstrates how fate is determined by ancestry and that almost all societies have similarly low social mobility rates. Challenging popular assumptions about mobility and revealing the deeply entrenched force of inherited advantage, <i>The Son Also Rises</i> is sure to prompt intense debate for years to come.</p></p><p><p>"This is the most exciting research on the 'American Dream' of social mobility to come along in many years. <i>The Son Also Rises</i> provides deep insights into not only the ability or inability of children to surpass their parents' socioeconomic class, but also into the surprising importance of the family to generate prosperity in general."<b>--William Easterly, author of <i>The White Man's Burden</i></b></p><p>"<i>The Son Also Rises</i> is a remarkable challenge to conventional wisdom about social mobility. Using highly original methods and ranging widely across world history, Clark argues that the activities of governments impact mobility much less than most of us think--and that the only sure path to success is to be born to the right parents. Everyone interested in public policy should read this book."<b>--Ian Morris, author of <i>Why the West Rules--for Now</i></b></p><p>"An important and original contribution to the literature on social mobility, <i>The Son Also Rises</i> is provocative and adversarial, and a brilliant tour de force.

Extremely current throughout, this text thoroughly explores the effects of earthquakes and active tectonic systems on humans, geomorphic systems, and Earth&#39;s topography. Complete with numerous case studies in a variety of regions, the very latest advances in the field, separate quantitative techniques boxed sections, and a host of pedagogical aids.<p> Active tectonics is the study of dynamic tectonic processes that shape the landscape and have an impact on human society. Tectonic geomorphology is the part of active tectonics that is concerned with landforms produced by tectonic processes and the application of geomorphic principles to tectonic problems. Tectonic geomorphology increasingly has become one of the principal tools in a variety of applications, including identification of active faults, formation of geologic structures, seismic-hazard assessment, and the study of landscape evolution. Tectonic geomorphology has proven to be useful in these applications because tectonically produced landforms are created and preserved over time intervals ideal for recording landscape change. </p><p> This book requires a basic knowledge of geologic principles. It is appropriate for upper-division undergraduate students, graduate students, and others who work in the ,fields of geology, geomorphology, and earthquake studies. In universities, this book is appropriate for classes in active tectonics, tectonic geomorphology, earthquake geology, and geomorphology. </p><p> The field of active tectonics has expanded rapidly during the past decade or so, but it remains at the cutting edge of geologic research. Space-based positioning, analysis of digital topography, and new dating techniques are bringing a whole new class of information to studies of the dynamic Earth. Advances in topics such as buried reverse faulting, active fold growth, earthquake recurrence, climate change, isostasy, and long-term landscape evolution continue to refine and redefine our understanding of tectonic and geomorphic processes. </p><p> We hope the readers of this book will find it to be an up-to-date source of information, as well as a solid foundation for understanding future advances in the fields of active tectonics and tectonic geomorphology.

He is fleeing the atmosphere of menace he feels around him and the fear that grips him. Fear of war? Of imminent catastrophe? Of others? Whatever it may be, the proximity of Switzerland, to which he plans to run at the first sign of danger, gives him temporary reassurance.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The young man hides among the other summer visitors until he meets a beautiful young actress named Yvonne Jacquet, and a strange doctor, Ren� Meinthe.

Written for a generation presented with challenges of terrible proportions--the Industrial, American, and French Revolutions, to name the most obvious--Burke's <em>Reflections of the Revolution in France</em> displays an acute awareness of how high political stakes can be, as well as a keen ability to set contemporary problems within a wider context of political theory.</p><p>Rethinking the Western Tradition SeriesThe French Revolution is a defining moment in world history, and usually it has been first approached by English-speaking readers through the picture painted of it by Edmund Burke. Reflections on the Revolution in France is a classic work in a range of fields from history through political science to literature, and securely holds its place among the canon of &#x201c;great books.&#x201d; Yet its meaning is still contested and often misunderstood, equally by those who wish to admire or to denigrate Burke for his present-day relevance. This edition aims to locate Burke once again in his contemporary political and intellectual setting. Alone among recent versions, it reprints the text of the first edition of the Reflections, and shows how Burke amended it as his knowledge of the Revolution deepened. It is certain to become the standard edition for scholars and students alike.<br>The editor&#x2019;s Introduction is much more extensive than that of any previous edition. It situates the Reflections in Burke&#x2019;s life and the development of his ideas, the history of English political thought, the debate about the French Revolution, and the debate the book itself inspired. But the Introduction is more than a compendium of information; it is a thoughtful, coherent interpretation of Burke and his book. The editor&#x2019;s notes are also fuller than those of any previous edition, glossing many literary and biblical allusions missed by previous editors. He also supplies an extended note on the text, a biographical guide, and a bibliography, helpfully presented in discursive form.<br><br></p><h2>Calculus: For Business, Economics, and the Social and Life Sciences</h2><p>This calculus text is designed for students in the fields of business, economics, psychology, sociology, architecture and other areas in the life sciences.

(starred review) (<i>Publishers Weekly</i> 2009-09-28)<br><br>Robert Service delivers an outstanding, fascinating biography of this dazzling titan. It is compelling as an adventure story--the ultimate rise and fall--but also revelatory as the scholarly revision of a historical reputation...The portrait of Trotsky's forgotten world of Jewish farmers and poverty-stricken Russian aristocrats is eccentric and intriguing. Trotsky himself hid much of his background that Service reveals for the first time...At the end of Service's revision, what remains of the Prophet? The intellectual, orator, manager of the Bolshevik coup and architect of the Civil War victory remain, but alongside them must be laid the mendacity of his memoirs, the ugly egotism and unpleasant, overweening arrogance, the belief in and enthusiastic practice of killing on a colossal scale, the political ineptitude, the limit of ambition. Apart from their famous row about "socialism in one country" versus international revolution, there was little politically between Stalin and Trotsky. It was personality that divided them and both personalities were highly unattractive. If Trotsky had become dictator, Service is clear that while Russia would have avoided Stalin's personal sadism, the same millions would still have been killed. (Simon Sebag Montefiore <i>Sunday Telegraph</i> 2009-10-11)<br><br>In this astonishingly comprehensive book--Robert Service has trawled almost every archive on the planet that has any reference to Trotsky--we get a clear picture of Trotsky's political development, his part in the 1917 revolution, his differences with Lenin, his break with Stalin and, finally, the years of exile and agitation in which he attracted a ragbag of bizarre followers and made the mistake of professing that there was a form of communism different to Stalin's...This is a superb work of scholarship, and above all leaves the reader in no doubt as to the evil of Trotsky, not just in politics but in his personal life...If you seek to know about this crucial figure in the history of Marxism-Leninism, this book will tell you everything. (Simon Heffer <i>Daily Telegraph</i> 2009-10-24)<br><br>If only, his adherents argued, it had been Trotsky who had succeeded Lenin and not Stalin, then the USSR might have been spared its famines and its terrors, its show trials and its denials of freedom...Now, 50 years after the last full-scale biography of Trotsky in English, Robert Service has turned his attention to this myth--and has, effectively, assassinated Trotsky all over again...If one can imagine the most obnoxious middle-class student radical one has ever met--bitter, sneering, arrogant, selfish, cocky, callous, callow, blinkered and condescending--and if one freezes that image, applies a pair of pince-nez and transports it back to the beginning of the last century, then one has Trotsky...Service makes it absolutely plain that Trotskyism was Stalinism in embryo...Seldom has the pathology of the revolutionary type, and its murderous consequences, been more mercilessly exposed than in this exemplary biography. (Robert Harris <i>Sunday Times</i> 2009-10-18)<br><br>Distinguishing the work is its extensive use of archival sources and rare contemporary published materials, much of it used for the first time in this biography. Service casts a critical eye on Trotsky's own writings and the interpretations of his followers and finds Trotsky's diagnosis of his defeat by Stalin self-serving and misleading...Service succeeds in recovering many of the aspects of Trotsky's life that the revolutionary and his followers tried to bury...A readable and persuasive biography that should be required reading for students of the Soviet Union and the history of world communism. (Sean Pollock <i>Library Journal (starred review)</i> 2009-11-01)<br><br>The idea that a humane communism could have come out of Trotskyism is pure romanticism, Service says. Yet, Trotskyites maintain even today that the tragedy of Soviet history lay in Trotsky's failure to win the battle of succession for leadership of the Soviet Union. Service's biography will not convince them otherwise. But for those with an open mind, <i>Trotsky: A Biography</i> shows that in the end, Stalin and Trotsky were blood brothers. Blood being the operative word. (Christopher Orlet <i>American Spectator</i> 2009-11-17)<br><br>Robert Service fashions a vivid portrait of this brilliant, merciless ideologue, who did not hesitate to drag his country kicking, screaming and bleeding toward the utopia he dreamed of creating for it...[Service] approaches Trotsky without emotional or ideological attachment. He has also mined a rich lode of newly accessible archival material, including documents that reveal Trotsky's support for cruel methods while Lenin was still actively leading the government...More than anything else, Service compels us to look at Trotsky as he really was rather than to accept the image that Trotsky conjured for himself. (Joshua Rubenstein <i>Wall Street Journal</i> 2009-11-18)<br><br><i>Trotsky</i> helps explain both the allure and the danger of the mass murderer who was affectionately known to his followers as "the Old Man." (Adam Kirsch <i>New Republic</i> 2009-12-07)<br><br>Trotsky, even before one of Stalin's agents found him in Mexico and assassinated him with an ice axe, was a romantic figure to those who believed that if only he had succeeded Lenin everything would have been better. Service, who has also written studies of Lenin and Stalin, does an excellent job of dispensing with such notions...Service's book, unlike much writing about Trotsky, is the work of a historian, not an ideologue, and the better for it. (<i>New Yorker</i> 2009-11-30)<br><br>Robert Service's iconoclastic yet rigorously balanced portrait of the fiery intellectual who helped Lenin cement Bolshevik power in Russia strips away the elaborate myths and lies that have buttressed Trotsky's place in the pantheon of revolutionary martyrs. Using new archival resources--including family letters, party and military correspondence, confidential notes, and, perhaps most interesting of all, medical records--Service gives us a keen understanding of the character and intellect, peccadilloes and virtues of one of the key, yet wildly misunderstood figures in 20th century history...With his impressive book, Service completes his trilogy of the giants--Lenin, Stalin and Trotsky--who fashioned the Soviet state. There is no facet of Trotsky's life that hasn't been examined in detail, from his character and finances to his quarrels with party comrades over the minutiae of Communist dogma and his struggle with his Jewish roots. Encyclopedic is the word, and it is oh, so well written. (Michael J. Bonafield <i>Minneapolis Star Tribune</i> 2009-11-28)<br><br><i>Trotsky</i> is fascinating, detailed, highly intelligent, and meticulously researched...Service is among the very best living historians of the Soviet Union and Russia, and he is supremely good at stitching together the broad outlines of complex lives and developments. (Peter Savodnik <i>Commentary</i> 2009-12-01)<br><br>Service never lets his reader forget Trotsky's callousness, and rightly so: on the few occasions that Trotsky worked in conjunction with Stalin--suppressing the Orthodox Church, deporting dissident intellectuals--he equalled or even exceeded the Georgian in ruthlessness. Some of the worst aspects of the Soviet system, such as the use of military force to exterminate rebellious starving peasants, or the exploitation of concentration camp inmates for hard labour, were devised by Trotsky...<i>Trotsky</i> is the final part of a triptych, and you can sense the author's enjoyment as he completes his heroic task. (Donald Rayfield <i>Times Literary Supplement</i> 2009-10-21)<br><br>In a sober narrative thick with political details, both fresh and familiar, Service deflates the notion that the Old Man offered either a humane or plausible alternative to his unlamented comrades. The only major difference between Trotsky and his fellow Bolshevik leaders was that he never got the chance to wield total power...Service is the first major biographer of Trotsky to portray him as myopic villain instead of defeated prophet. (Michael Kazin <i>The Daily Beast</i> 2009-12-08)<br><br>Trotsky, the Bolshevik most powerfully associated with persisting hopes of global transformation, has had many biographers including the classic trilogy by Isaac Deutscher. Robert Service, less admiring by far, has uncovered a mass of new information, some of which makes for a pretty unattractive view of the man. <i>Trotsky: A Biography</i> is sparkling on his political and personal travails, and indeed his crimes and follies. (Stephen Howe <i>The Independent</i> 2009-12-11)<br><br>A massive study of Trotsky, a grotesque character, politically and personally, even by the demanding standards of communism. (Joseph C. Goulden <i>Washington Times</i> 2009-12-28)<br><br>In [Service's] account, he is a figure more of fascination than admiration--quite in contrast to earlier biographies written by his devotees. He is a compelling crowd rouser but remote and cold personally, puritanical but more than a little lascivious, and the object of fervid political devotion yet ruthless in the pursuit of his compassionless notion of revolution. Service deals with Trotsky's life from boyhood to the end but concentrates on the critical period from his days as a youthful revolutionary and foe of Bolshevism through the 1920s and the dramatic arc from his ascendancy to his defeat. The writing is trim and unadorned, allowing Service to march expeditiously over new ground: Trotsky's early political affinity with Stalin, the smug self-confidence that worked against him in the post-1923 maneuvering, and his moments of striking political insight, which were matched by those of disastrous misjudgment. (Robert Legvold <i>Foreign Affairs</i> 2010-01-01)<br><br>[Service] has produced a valuable handbook on the life of one of the twentieth century's most fascinating--and still puzzling--personalities. (Stephen Schwartz <i>First Things</i> 2010-02-02)<br><br>Robert Service has written what will undoubtedly be the definitive biography of Trotsky...It is the achievement in particular of Robert Service not only to have uncovered new material from previously unavailable Soviet archives, but to have cast new light on many of his writings and activities. He forces us to reinterpret drastically what it was Trotsky believed and fought for. Rather than being some kind of alternative to Stalin, Trotsky undoubtedly would have created a regime as monstrous and horrific as that which came to exist. (Ronald Radosh <i>New Criterion</i> 2010-05-01)<br><br>This absorbing, well-written biography presents a major reassessment of the life and career of Leon Trotsky...The biography is distinctive, in part, because it casts a critical yet judicious and well-founded view on Trotsky's life and is written by distinguished Oxford historian Service, who has a deep understanding of the events and actors of the period. The author uses newly available archival materials such as telegrams, letters, and other documents to build a more accurate portrayal of his complex subject. In addition, Service reconsiders the large volume of materials that has long been available about Trotsky and subjects it to innovative scrutiny that often yields interesting results...This book will undoubtedly become the standard biography of Trotsky, and it is unlikely to be superseded for many years.

Brooks <i>Choice</i> 2010-04-01)</p><h2>Please Pay Attention Please: Bruce Nauman&#39;s Words: Writings and Interviews (Writing Art)</h2><p><p><b>The most comprehensive collection to date of the artist Bruce Nauman's writings plus all of his major interviews from 1965 to 2001.</b></p><p>Since the 1960s, the artist Bruce Nauman has developed a highly complex and pluralistic oeuvre ranging from discrete sculpture, performance, film, video, and text-based works to elaborate multipart installations incorporating sound, video recording and monitors, and architectural structures. Nauman's work is often interpreted in terms of movements and mediums, including performance, postminimalism, process, and conceptual art, thereby emphasizing its apparent eclecticism. But what is often overlooked is that underlying these seemingly disparate artistic tendencies are conceptual continuities, one of which is an investigation of the nature of language.</p><p>Unlike many of his contemporaries, Nauman has refrained from participating in the critical discourse surrounding his own work. He has given relatively few interviews over the course of his career and has little to do with the art press or critical establishment. Indeed, he granted Janet Kraynak and The MIT Press almost complete autonomy in the preparation of this volume. In contrast to Nauman's reputation for silence, however, from the beginning of his career, the incorporation of language has been a central feature of his art. This collection takes as its starting point the seeming paradox of an artist of so few words who produces an art of so many words.</p><p><i>Please Pay Attention Please</i> contains all of Nauman's major interviews from 1965 to 2001, as well as a comprehensive body of his writings, including instructions and proposal texts, dialogues transcribed from audio-video works, and prose texts written specifically for installation sculptures. Where relevant, the texts are accompanied by illustrations of the artworks for which they were composed. In the critical essay that serves as the book's introduction, the editor investigates Nauman's art in relation to the linguistic turn in art practices of the 1960s&#x2015;understanding language through the speech act&#x2015;and its legacy in contemporary art.</p></p><p>Janet Kraynak is a New York-based art historian.Nauman's eerily intuitive way of creating sophisticated, intellectually angular art out of simple gestures-a 10-minute film called "Bouncing Two Balls between the Floor and Ceiling with Changing Rhythms," for example, in which the artist does just that-builds fascination out of repetition's blandness. This set of collected writings is essential for anyone wishing to explore the ideas behind Nauman's practices, even if it duplicates much of the recent Art + Performance volume (Johns Hopkins, 2003) on Nauman and is nearly twice as expensive. Of the group of 19 artist's writings in this book, nine do not appear in the earlier volume on Nauman; one of these, a cheeky comment on "earth art," was intended to be skywritten and is a single line: "Leave the Land Alone." Nauman is mild and reticent as an interviewee, but nine of the 14 interviews here are exclusive to this book, and one-the extensive 1980 interview by Michele de Angelus-has never before appeared in complete form. The long introduction by Kraynak (Andy Warhol: Unique Prints from the Estate of Rupert Jasen Smith) is more satisfactory in its marshaling of basic semantic theory to explain Nauman's relationship to words, and his words' relationships to their contexts, but it lacks the cathartic insights one might expect in such a tight focus on his language. It also avoids the issue of Nauman's relation to other conceptual artists who use words extensively: she opts for Bakhtin and Benveniste, for example, over Ruscha or Holzer. Nauman courts extreme, even clinical, thinking, if only as a way to achieve practical and reliable experiences in art, as when Nauman comments on his use of puns: "I think humor is used a lot of the time to keep people from getting too close. Humor side-steps and shifts the meaning." So do these pieces, but that may be the point. <br>Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Principles of Optics: Electromagnetic Theory of Propagation, Interference and Diffraction of Light</h2><p>Principles of Optics is one of the classic science books of the twentieth century.

Our fear, and the collective breath or brace for the hateful backlash that ensued, symbolize the existential tightrope that defines Muslim American identity today.&#x201d;</i><br> &nbsp;<br> The term &#x201c;Islamophobia&#x201d; may be fairly new, but irrational fear and hatred of Islam and Muslims is anything but. Though many speak of Islamophobia&#x2019;s roots in racism, have we considered how anti-Muslim rhetoric is rooted in our legal system?<br> &nbsp;<br> Using his unique lens as a critical race theorist and law professor, Khaled A. Beydoun captures the many ways in which law, policy, and official state rhetoric have fueled the frightening resurgence of Islamophobia in the United States. Beydoun charts its long and terrible history, from the plight of enslaved African Muslims in the antebellum South and the laws prohibiting Muslim immigrants from becoming citizens to the ways the war on terror assigns blame for any terrorist act to Islam and the myriad trials Muslim Americans face in the Trump era. He passionately argues that by failing to frame Islamophobia as a system of bigotry endorsed and emboldened by law and carried out by government actors, U.S. society ignores the injury it inflicts on both Muslims and non-Muslims. Through the stories of Muslim Americans who have experienced Islamophobia across various racial, ethnic, and socioeconomic lines, Beydoun shares how U.S. laws shatter lives, whether directly or inadvertently. And with an eye toward benefiting society as a whole, he recommends ways for Muslim Americans and their allies to build coalitions with other groups. Like no book before it, <i>American Islamophobia</i> offers a robust and genuine portrait of Muslim America then and now.</p><p>&#x201c;Deftly pairing his deep legal expertise with a searching moral dialogue, Khaled A. Beydoun breaks down U.S. Islamophobia as the full-fledged system that it is&#x2014;one with a very specific history, but tightly linked to other forms of white supremacy. This book meets the moment, but it is also packed with staying power. A crucial contribution to building the powerful, broad-based, and diverse movement that is our only hope.&#x201d;&#x2014;Naomi Klein, author of&nbsp;<i>No Is Not Enough</i>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<i>This Changes Everything</i><br> &nbsp;<br><br> &#x201c;This compelling book is an exquisite testament to what it means to subvert Islamophobia. Beydoun stands out as a brilliant scholar and advocate who gives voice and attention to the neglected stories of Black Muslims along with the poor, working class, and undocumented.&#x201d;&#x2014;Kimberl� Williams Crenshaw, Professor of Law, Columbia Law School and UCLA School of Law<br> &nbsp;<br><br> &#x201c;In this political climate, Beydoun is a much-needed and critical voice, analyst, commentator, and researcher. Unapologetically Muslim and Arab American, he speaks and writes truth to power, steering us away from comfort and forcing us to confront racism through our own relationships with it. Brilliant and witty, he tells it like it is.&#x201d;&#x2014;Linda Sarsour, cochair of the 2017 Women&#x2019;s March&nbsp;<br> &#x201c;At a time when casual hate-mongering emanates from the highest level of the U.S. government, <i>American Islamophobia</i> provides precisely what is necessary to understand the dark days we are living through. Beydoun brilliantly dissects the tropes that are central to the deliberate construction of Islam as the ultimate hostile other. He draws on his legal training and his experience in national security policing and civil liberties advocacy to draw a stark portrait of this ugly time of carefully curated xenophobia and mass hatred that Muslims, Hispanics, and many others are enduring. I can think of no book that could be more timely.&#x201d;&#x2014;Rashid Khalidi, author of<i> Brokers of Deceit: How the U.S. Has Undermined Peace in the Middle East</i><br> &#x201c;A triumphant act of moral restitution. Written with bravura flair, academic authority, and panoramic scholarly panache, <i>American Islamophobia</i> declares the birth of an American Muslim intellectual who wholly claims the land and envisions a bold future for it. This is no simple diagnosis of a racist pathology in a nation. It announces the brave surfacing of a subterranean voice rooted in the moral imaginary of a liberated America.&#x201d;&#x2014;Hamid Dabashi, author of <i>Iran Without Borders: Towards a Critique of the Postcolonial Nation</i><br><br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;This is an urgent book for anyone seeking a comprehensive understanding of Islamophobia today.&#x201d;&#x2014;Evelyn Alsultany, author of<i> Arabs and Muslims in the Media: Race and Representation after 9/11</i><br><br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;This is a highly readable, deeply personal, and fiercely intellectual analysis of endemic social and structural Islamophobia throughout American history.

I am sorry to say it, but he was brainwashed.'&nbsp;--Robin Reid, father of shoebomber, Richard&nbsp;Dr Andr�s Zakar was returning from morning mass at Viziv�ros Convent on Sunday, 19 November 1948 when an unmarked car pulled up alongside him. Silently, three men in dark suits leaped out, grabbed the doctor by the arms and bundled him on to the back seat. They climbed in after him, slammed the doors and, with a screech of tyres, accelerated away.&nbsp;To passers-by there was nothing especially remarkable about this incident. Hungarians had been told that the state was under threat and that conspirators were everywhere: the secret police were snatching dissidents more or less continously. What made this case unusual was the victim. Dr Zakar was personal secretary to J�sef Mindszenty, head of the Catholic Church in Hungary and the most senior cardinal in Eastern Europe. Mindszenty, a potential successor to Pope Pius XII, was a powerful man; the 'disappearance' of his secretary was ominous.&nbsp;Five weeks later the secret police returned Dr Zakar to the cardinal's official residence in Esztergom. But the Zakar they delivered on Christmas Eve 1948 wasn't the same Zakar who had left the month before. Something had happened to him. His eyes looked strange. He was confused and disoriented, as if in a twilight state of consciousness. The normally taciturn thirty-five-year-old doctor of theology behaved like a child, babbling and giggling constantly. At one point he ran down the corridors, shrieking. Officers accompanying Zakar treated him like a madman, repeatedly reminding him that they fed him meat twice a week. In return, he simpered as if they were his closest friends. 'He seemed,' recalled Gyula M�tkai, the cardinal's chief secretary, 'to be having a very good time with them.'&nbsp;Ordered to search the building for incriminating evidence, Zakar took off at a gallop, leading the officers to a room in the basement where he pointed to a spot on the ground. Digging a few inches beneath the soil, the policemen discovered a metal box full of Mindszenty's confidential correspondence. They then congratulated the smirking Zakar and shepherded him back to the secret police headquarters at 60 Andrassy Street in Budapest for more 'treatment'.&nbsp;At 6.45 p.m. on Boxing Day, Mindszenty and his elderly mother were making their way downstairs after evening mass when there was a furious banging at the door. The cardinal ordered it to be opened, to find himself facing a group of armed men. Lieutenant-Colonel Gyula D�csi stepped forward. 'We have come to arrest you,' he told Mindszenty. The cardinal asked to see the warrant but D�csi shook his head. 'We don't need one.'&nbsp;Mindszenty knelt, kissed his mother's hand and said a prayer, then picked up his coat and hat and handed himself in to the custody of the arresting officers. The last sounds he heard as he was led away into the night were the voices of his colleagues who, realising that his arrest spelt the end of Catholicism in Hungary under Soviet occupation, had spontaneously started singing the national anthem.&nbsp;Mindszenty's staff were dumbfounded by his arrest but initially it was the behaviour of his secretary that most baffled everyone. How could the loyal Dr Zakar have betrayed the cardinal? Why had he behaved so bizarrely? Clearly, they thought, something strange had happened to him.&nbsp;By the time he arrived in court five weeks later, something strange had happened to Cardinal Mindszenty, too. In the dock he swayed backwards and forwards, unsteady on his feet. His eyes were half closed and he was uncoordinated, like a sleepwalker. He spoke in a monotone, as if repeating facts by rote. At times he paused for up to ten seconds between words. Apparently unable to follow the course of his own trial, this highly educated, intelligent man stood, eyes glazed, totally bewildered.&nbsp;Worse than his appearance, however, was what he said. As Mindszenty stared into the middle distance, he confessed that he had orchestrated the theft of Hungary's crown jewels--including the country's most sacred relic, the Crown of St Stephen--with the explicit purpose of crowning Otto von Habsburg emperor of Eastern Europe. He admitted that he had schemed to remove the Communist government; that he had planned a Third World War and that, once this war was won by the Americans, he himself would assume political power in Hungary.&nbsp;The confessions were patent nonsense. Since the end of the war, Mindszenty had indeed opposed the Communist takeover of Hungary but he was no revolutionary, and he certainly wasn't a traitor. At one point in court he agreed that he had met Otto von Habsburg in Chicago on 21 June 1947; in fact, Habsburg had not been in Chicago and the cardinal had not been in the United States on that date. Moreover, Western observers soon discovered that Mindszenty had specifically warned Church officials of his impending arrest by the Communists. Afraid that he might buckle under torture, he had written letters just weeks before he was picked up to the five most senior Catholic officials in Hungary with instructions that they were to be opened only in the event of his arrest. The letters stated categorically that he had not taken part in any conspiracy and that he would never resign his episcopal see.&nbsp;Asked in court about them, Mindszenty appeared to have changed his mind. 'I did not see then many things which I see today,' he slurred. 'The statement I made is not valid.' He also offered to resign.&nbsp;To those who knew him, Mindszenty had undergone a radical transformation. A source close to Pope Pius XII commented that the Mindszenty on trial was 'not the man that we knew'. British Foreign Office analysis concluded that he was 'a tired or resigned man wholly unlike what we know of the Cardinal's real personality'. Even his mother agreed, telling the press that when she was allowed to see him in jail 'he was a completely changed man, without will and without consciousness'. At one point when she visited him, he had failed to recognise her altogether.&nbsp;The cardinal's handwriting seemed to have changed, too. Comparisons of his signature before and after the arrest revealed considerable differences. According to an Italian graphologist, Mindszenty was 'no longer capable of writing his customary signature'. Sure enough, in the month of the trial, two Hungarian handwriting experts, Laszlo Sulner and Hanna Fischhof, defected to Austria and confessed to working on the case. Initially, they said, they had been called in to forge the cardinal's confessions but it soon became clear that this would not be necessary: he was signing them of his own accord. According to the two experts, documents emerging at the start of Mindszenty's interrogation contained denials, but within a fortnight they were full of confessions. 'The mind which impelled the pen in the first instance,' reported Sulner, 'was not the mind which impelled the pen in the second instance.' Something strange, indeed, had happened to the cardinal.&nbsp;In the West, the appearance of a powerful, resolute man publicly confessing to crimes he couldn't possibly have committed immediately rang a bell. The same thing had happened in Moscow a decade earlier. At the time, Stalin had arrested a number of his inner circle and placed them on trial for horrendous--but wholly implausible--crimes.&nbsp;The Moscow Show Trials (1936-38) presented the macabre spectacle of the Soviet state prosecutor, Andrei Vyshinsky, howling repeatedly that the accused were 'mad dogs', 'dogs gone mad' and 'dirty dogs' that should be 'taken out and shot', while the supposed conspirators fell over each other to agree with him. Many stated from the outset that their crimes were so heinous that they had no right even to offer a defence. Sergei Mrachovsky--a man with impeccable revolutionary credentials--confessed to a bizarre plot to murder Stalin. Lev Kamenev stated that he was a 'bloodthirsty enemy' of the Soviet Union who, in an act of 'contemptible treachery', had tried to assassinate Kirov. Richard Pickel admitted to assisting with the planning for this assassination, referring to himself as 'the dregs of the land'. And yet there was not a shred of evidence that any of these confessions was true. The defendants then turned on themselves and each other. Edouard Holtzman declared that he and his friends were 'not only murderers but fascist murderers'. To Yuri Piatakov, meanwhile, the crimes of his fellow defendants were so grave that he asked permission to shoot them himself. One was his ex-wife.&nbsp;In this Kafkaesque nightmare, defendants not only demanded to be found guilty, but also requested the most severe punishment. Arkady Rosengoltz stated that 'I don't want to live after this disgrace', A.A. Shestov that 'The proletarian court must not, and cannot, spare my life.' Shestov's only remaining goal, he said, was to 'stand with calmness on the place of my execution and with my blood to wash away the stain of a traitor to my country'. He wasn't the only one who wanted to die. 'I am a traitor to my party,' concluded Mrachovsky, 'who should be shot.' He was. They all were--after first thanking the prosecutor, Vyshinsky, for honouring them with the ultimate sentence.&nbsp;The spectacle of hardened revolutionaries lining up to sign their own death warrants created worldwide consternation. Was it really possible that these men were guilty? In response to public concern the United States established the Dewey Commission to find out. It eventually decided that the Soviet confessions were so inherently improbable that they couldn't possibly be true. 'We therefore find,' concluded the report, 'the Moscow Trials to be frame-ups.'&nbsp;But if they were 'frame-ups', how was it done? What would it take to make grown men publicly vilify themselves and their lives' work like this? There were no outward signs that any of the defendants had been tortured. And even if they had, why didn't any of them burst out with the truth in court? They must have known that they were going to be shot anyway. It was speculated that the Soviets had used drugs or hypnosis on the victims. But no one knew. 'No mystery in history,' reported the Daily Mail, 'matches what is going on in Moscow.'&nbsp;A decade after the mysterious Show Trials, history seemed to be repeating itself in the Mindszenty case. The cardinal, reported the Evening Standard, was a 'bewildered man, ready like all other Soviet victims to confess to whatever was laid to his charge'. The Daily Telegraph agreed that he was 'not in full possession of his faculties'. Some commentators even speculated that the man in the dock was not Mindszenty but an impostor. It was a supremely unlikely theory but, faced with such an improbable spectacle, what theory wasn't?&nbsp;As had been the case during the Show Trials, the press was keen to attribute the strange confessions to the use of drugs. In a piece entitled 'Mindszenty: drug? Third degree? Hypnosis?' the Daily Mail reported that the cardinal had been dosed with 'confession drugs such as Benzedrine, amphetamine, scopolamine and actedron'. A RAND Institute study of the confession phenomenon concurred, concluding that the Soviets were using drugs and hypnosis, among other techniques, to prepare victims for trial. Church authorities felt the same: a spokesman for Pius XII commented that if Mindszenty had indeed confessed, he had been forced to do so by drugs. Whatever the technique used to make him talk, however, someone was going to pay for it. On 31 December 1948, the pope excommunicated everyone involved in the cardinal's arrest and interrogation.&nbsp;The British Foreign Office debated the issue for some time. Admittedly, the cardinal was 'not normal' at his trial, and there was some evidence that Soviet interrogators used drugs to 'undermine the nerves and will-power'. But generally the mood was sceptical. Accounts of widespread drug use were, says one dispatch from Vienna, 'journalistic embroidery'. According to a top-secret document dated 10 February 1949, Mindszenty had probably been persuaded to confess by less subtle means: Dr Zakar had been beaten 'half dead' and paraded in front of his boss, who had immediately buckled.&nbsp;But the diplomats weren't entirely convinced by their own theory: if Zakar had been savagely beaten, why did he show no sign of it at the trial? 'All told,' concludes the Foreign Office file, 'the Cardinal's confession remains as much of a mystery as ever.'&nbsp;American authorities agreed. The trial was an enigma. The only thing that was clear was that something had happened to Mindszenty and, whatever it was, it was deeply sinister. 'Somehow,' wrote US Army intelligence adviser Paul Linebarger, 'they took his soul apart.'&nbsp;Three years after Mindszenty was sentenced to life imprisonment for his 'crimes', another bombshell hit. In Korea.&nbsp;On the night of 13 January 1952, pilots Kenneth L. Enoch and John S. Quinn of the 3rd US Air Force Bomb Group were shot down over North Korea. Four months later, on 16 May, the two men made an extraordinary confession to a group of Chinese interrogators. They had, they said, been deploying biological weapons, including anthrax, typhus, cholera and plague, over Korea. The weapon-delivery systems, said Quinn, were 'still in the experimental stage' but effective. 'I was forced,' he stated, 'to be the tool of these [American] warmongers and made to . . . do this awful crime against the people of Korea and the Chinese volunteers.' The men's confessions were taped and broadcast on Peking Radio the next day. Moscow Radio soon took up the cause, and the East began accusing the West of war crimes.&nbsp;Nine months later, in February 1953, Colonel Frank H. Schwable, Chief of Staff of the US First Marine Wing, confirmed Enoch and Quinn's allegations. Schwable, who had been shot down on 8 July the previous year, gave explicit details of the operation. According to his statement, the US biological-weapons programme was numbered VMF-513 and codenamed SUBPROP. The US Joint Chiefs of Staff had green-lighted the project in October 1951.&nbsp;First operational tests had been run, said Schwable, in November that year using B-29s from Okinawa, Japan, but pretty soon bacteria-delivery devices were being fitted to other aircraft including Tiger Cats, Skyraiders, Corsairs and Panthers. The testing was so secret that even the pilots concerned were not allowed to know what they were carrying. Naturally, other allies in the United Nations were not informed, either.&nbsp;Schwable explained that canisters containing the germs were dropped at various altitudes across diverse terrain and over different-sized cities to enable the US military to determine how the bacteria spread, and thus to calculate th...</p><h2>Water Buffalo Theology (25th Anniversary Edition, Revised &amp; Expanded)</h2><p>Water Buffalo Theology marked the emergence of a self-conscious Asian Christian theology, on the world scene when it was published in 1974.

He here recounts his travels and encounters on the islands, telling of magic wells, poteen drinkers, fishing expeditions in currachs, and<br>stories of druids and fairies. The book includes fourteen of Synge's own photographs, depicting many fascinating aspects of island life.</p><p>Nothing much happens on the Aran Islands--at least, not much went on there in the late 19th century, when John Synge sailed out to these mist-shrouded, salt-sprayed, and wave-battered chunks of rocks south of Ireland. Therein lies the charm of the setting and of this lovely book, which captures the saltiness of both the marine air and the time-lost characters, who deeply believe in the magical "wee people." In cottages where nets and fishing tackle hang from beams, the women (who always wear red dresses and petticoats, as do some of the boys) sit at their spinning wheels or sew cow-skin sandals, while the fishermen spin yarns about fairies, sunken vessels, and bags of gold gained from adulterous wives. The big happening of the year is when roofs are rethatched--an event that blossoms into a festival with twisted rope stretching from kitchen table through lane to nearby field. Synge seems an ambassador from a different world: addressed as "noble person," he brings tokens of modernity--be they clocks or simple magic tricks that beguile the locals. First published in 1907, this re-released travelogue gives a poignant peek into another time and begs a visit to the Aran Islands to see how, or if, they have changed. <i>--Melissa Rossi</i>Scotland has always done things its own way, and that is what akes the country&#39;s history so interesting. More than four thousand years ago, its Stone Age inhabitants were among the most advanced builders of Europe. About two thousand years ago, the Romans decided it was wiser to build a wall than attempt conquest. A thousand years ago, Scotland was one of the first medieval European kingdoms to emerge as a political unity from the Dark Ages. The decendants of those first Scots still inhabit the country. This original and immensely readable history charts the long, painful, sometimes tragic, often inspiring process that has formed the Scottish people of today. It reveals how the Scots&#39; sense of nationhood has always been under test and how that pressure has shaped the ways in which they see themselves and are seen by others. A special and unique feature are the &#39;fact windows&#39; in the text. They light up many fascinating aspects of the national story not normally covered in history books and present a range of outstanding people who at different times have played a part in Scotland&#39;s life and still-evolving history.</p><h2>Jack Whitten: Five Decades of Painting</h2><p>For five decades, New York-based artist Jack Whitten (born 1939) has explored the possibilities of paint, the role of the artist and the allure of materials. As a child of the segregated South, he bears witness to expressions of evil and the resilience of the human spirit. From his first spectral canvases to his recent mosaic canvases, Whitten&#39;s compelling compositions have spanned a half-century of artistic innovation. Showcasing approximately 60 canvases, this survey--the first substantial volume on the artist--reveals Whitten as an innovator who uses abstraction in its newest idioms to achieve an enduring gravitas. Whitten&#39;s abiding engagement with scientific systems (as structure), social issues (as evidence) and commitment to the power of visual expression (materiality) show him to be an artist both of his time and for the present.</p><p></p><h2>Oracle of Mystical Moments</h2><p>Visionary collage artist Catrin Welz-Stein intermixes unexpected elements of nature and imagination, creating a sumptuous world where flower spirits and floating castles happily co-exist.

With his unusual powers of imaginative re-creation, Berlin brings to life original minds that swam against the current of their times--and still challenge conventional wisdom.</p><br><p> In a new foreword to this corrected edition, which also includes a new appendix of letters in which Berlin discusses and further illuminates some of its topics, noted essayist Mark Lilla argues that Berlin's decision to give up a philosophy fellowship and become a historian of ideas represented not an abandonment of philosophy but a decision to do philosophy by other, perhaps better, means. "His instinct told him," Lilla writes, "that you learn more about an idea as an idea when you know something about its genesis and understand why certain people found it compelling and were spurred to action by it." This collection of fascinating intellectual portraits is a rich demonstration of that belief.</p></p><p><p>"A Jewish refugee from Bolshevik Russia who found a home in the British establishment, Isaiah Berlin was always drawn to the traffic between insiders and outsiders, between fugitive experiences and dominant norms. We see this attraction in these classic essays: not only in his article on nationalism, which he saw as the work of non-nationals, but also in his continuous effort to introduce strange figures into the canon and to make canonical figures strange. Paddling against the current, Berlin made us feel the full extent and depth of its force."<b>--Corey Robin, City University of New York</b></p><p>"An excellent new edition.

The problem is that it appears to express merely a loosely connected set of often questionable opinions. Can Nietzsche really be an important philosopher if this is his most important book? Maudemarie Clark and David Dudrick address this question with a close reading that emphasizes how Nietzsche writes. They argue that the first part of Beyond Good and Evil presents coherent and interconnected arguments for subtle and well-thought-out positions on traditional issues. Nietzsche&#39;s infamous doctrine of the will to power turns out to be a compelling account of the structure and origin of the human soul. And although he rejects some aspects of traditional philosophy, Nietzsche&#39;s aim is to show how philosophy&#39;s traditional aspirations to seek both the true and the good can be fulfilled. Beyond Good and Evil turns out to be a major work of philosophy and Nietzsche&#39;s masterpiece.</p><p>This book is a provocative new interpretation of Nietzsche&#39;s Beyond Good and Evil, focusing especially on its first part. Nietzsche&#39;s masterpiece is not the loosely connected set of opinions it appears to be, but a tightly unified interpretation of both the history of philosophy and the human soul.Maudemarie Clark is Professor of Philosophy at University of California, Riverside and George Carleton, Jr Professor of Philosophy at Colgate University.

But this engaging, accessible biography also serves as group portrait of the Virginia aristocracy--and of its declining fortunes, as the colonial oligarchy was supplanted by an unrulier democracy. When she was only 18, Nancy was accused of having borne a child to her own sister's husband, Richard Randolph, who then allegedly murdered the newborn. Defended by Revolutionary legend Patrick Henry, Richard and Nancy were acquitted, and she returned to live with him and her sister. But the rumors persisted, and Richard's sudden death in 1796 only made them uglier. Many of the ugliest rumors were voiced by Richard's younger brother, Jack; Nancy's former suitor. Jack improved the debt-riddled family estates while he pursued a political career as a fiery states-rights congressman (a career that gets nearly as much of the author's attention as Nancy's life). Virginia-based journalist Alan Pell Crawford doesn't conclude definitively whether or not Jack actually believed Nancy had murdered his brother and had sexual relations with a slave, but the congressman certainly hated her enough to throw her off the family farm and repeat those stories later to her husband. At age 34, reduced to poverty and living in New York, the long-suffering Nancy married Gouverneur Morris, another wealthy veteran of the Revolutionary generation. Their happy union produced one child and endured until his death. Crawford, also the author of <i>Thunder on the Right</i>, pens a lively narrative that vividly evokes his characters: kindhearted, rather frivolous Nancy; urbane, unshockable Morris; irascible, overwrought Jack; and a host of cousins who are scattered throughout America's inbred, gossipy high society. Good fun and good history, to boot. <i>--Wendy Smith</i><b>Alan Pell Crawford</b> is the author of <i>Thunder on the Right: The "New Right" and the Politics of Resentment,</i> which <i>The New Republic</i> called "a significant work of political and intellectual history."

This book takes an encounter between the paragons of each movement&#x2015;the printer and entrepreneur Benjamin Franklin and the British-born revivalist George Whitefield&#x2015;as an opportunity to explore the meaning of the beginnings of modern science and rationality on one hand and evangelical religious enthusiasm on the other.</p><p>There are people who both represent the times in which they live and change them for the better. Franklin and Whitefield were two such men. The morning that they met, they formed a long and lucrative partnership: Whitefield provided copies of his journals and sermons, Franklin published them. So began one of the most unique, mutually profitable, and influential friendships in early American history. </p><p>By focusing this study on Franklin and Whitefield, Peter Charles Hoffer defines with great precision the importance of the Anglo-American Atlantic World of the eighteenth century in American history.

But how was he viewed by ordinary Italians during his lifetime? <br><br> In <em>Fascist Voices</em>, Christopher Duggan draws on thousands of letters sent to Mussolini, as well as private diaries and other primary documents, to show how Italian citizens lived and experienced the fascist regime under Mussolini from 1922-1943. Throughout the 1930s, Mussolini received about 1,500 letters a day from Italian men and women of all social classes writing words of congratulation, commiseration, thanks, encouragement, or entreaty on a wide variety of occasions: his birthday and saint's day, after he had delivered an important speech, on a major fascist anniversary, when a husband or son had been killed in action. While Duggan looks at some famous diaries-by such figures as the anti-fascist constitutional lawyer Piero Calamandrei; the philosopher Benedetto Croce; and the fascist minister Giuseppe Bottai-the majority of the voices here come from unpublished journals, diaries, and transcripts. Utilizing a rich collection of untapped archival material, Duggan explores "the cult of Il Duce," the religious dimensions of totalitarianism, and the extraordinarily intimate character of the relationship between Mussolini and millions of Italians. Duggan shows that the figure of Mussolini was crucial to emotional and political engagement with the regime; although there was widespread discontent throughout Italy, little of the criticism was directed at Il Duce himself. Duggan argues that much of the regime's appeal lay in its capacity to appropriate the language, values, and iconography of Roman Catholicism, and that this emphasis on blind faith and emotion over reason is what made Mussolini's Italy simultaneously so powerful and so insidious. <br> <br>Offering a unique perspective on the period, <em>Fascist Voices </em>captures the responses of private citizens living under fascism and unravels the remarkable mixture of illusions, hopes, and fears that led so many to support the regime for so long.<br></p><p><br><strong>Christopher Duggan</strong> is Professor of Modern Italian History at the University of Reading, Head of of the School of Languages and European Studies, and Director of the Centre for Modern Italian History.

This base is with you for the rest of your life and if it is not consulted or corrected, the present life of the person cannot always be improved successfully. The Tao says that you should treat your organs like children and make sure that they are all happy. This involves satisfying them with the five colors, five smells, and five tastes. <br><br>The practice of Five Element Nutrition relates Taoist food theories to your own astrological profile. Ancient Taoist texts describe foods as being &#x201c;hot for the liver&#x201d; or &#x201c;cooling for the kidneys&#x201d; or &#x201c;too yin for the heart,&#x201d; and in this way foodstuffs and aliments&#x2019; energy have been defined for 5,000 years. We can translate this by saying that warming or heating for an organ is &#x201c;yang&#x201d; and cooling is &#x201c;yin.&#x201d; There is also &#x201c;neutral&#x201d; which means that it is neither. Today we talk about pH or acid-alkaline balance, which again was not a concept that ancient Taoists could measure, but they understood and strived for a yin/yang balance. <br><br>Emotions effect digestion directly. As the ancient Chinese Taoists said, having anger and jealousy is like &#x201c;drinking vinegar.&#x201d; Indeed these negative wood emotions upset the balance of the wood organs, the liver and gall bladder, affecting the production and release of bile and digestive enzymes. These secretions will become more acid and we are quite likely to have a sour, acid taste in the mouth and stomach. Further, this upset in acid-alkaline balance will impede proper digestion. <br><br>Comparing the Western diet with Taoist and/or Asian diets and their effect on the individual, Master Chia realized that it is important to look at the Five Element energies the person was born with, as well as their present life and body, to understand and affect a food cure for their conditions. He also incorporated Western ways of looking at what a body could lack nutritionally compared with the person&#x2019;s Five Element profile and particular needs to balance the elements. Integrating these practices together, he developed the practice of Five Element Nutrition. <br><br><b>Chapter 1. Taoist Concept of Nutrition <br><br><i>Power Eating with Five Element Food Lists</i> <br></b><br>Having looked at the fundamental Taoist principals of nutrition, in the next chapters we will introduce the food lists, which have been complied over 30 years of Master Chia&#x2019;s development of 5 element nutrition. They show how foods can increase or decrease Fire, Earth, Metal, Water and Wood Chi. This information has then been organized into lists including lists for all the major organs. The idea is to use the food lists as part of the treatment for organ energy. <br><br>Therefore we can treat the organ by going to the list for that organ and looking at the way that foods affect the Chi of this organ. Similarly, you can also review the Five Element food lists to find foods that enhance a particular Element. <br><br><i><b>Metal Superfoods <br></b></i><br><b>1.</b> Cinnamon regulates blood increasing glucose metabolism, anti-oxidants, anti-microbial, reduces &#x2018;bad&#x2019; cholesterol &amp; triglycerides and regulates blood pressure. <br><br><b>2.</b> Garlic lowers &#x2018;bad&#x2019; cholesterol, triglycerides and blood pressure, has anti-coagulants, anti-viral, anti-parasitic, and anti-microbial as well as plaque dissolving properties.

Included is enhanced coverage of the latest security concerns regarding web applications.</p><p>The Universal Modeling Language (UML) is a flexible and comprehensive way to design and diagram any software development project. <i>Building Web Applications with UML</i> covers the Web Application Extension (WAE) for UML and includes enough background information about Web applications to ease traditional software analysts and designers into the world of the Web.<p> Author Jim Conallen divides the text into two logical parts: the first is dedicated to explaining the various Web application architectures out there, the second to the process of modeling such systems with UML. The first chapter concisely explains the basics of the standard elements of the Web such as HTML, HTTP, forms, frames, and session management. Subsequent chapters provide an excellent overview to server-side and client-side functionality, delving into key technologies such as Active Server Pages (ASP), Java applets, and XML.</p><p> The remainder of the book is devoted to defining the requirements, architecture, and design elements of Web applications using UML. The reader will learn about Use Cases, apply analysis, and represent Web applications with the distinctive graphical elements of UML. A sample ASP application is used to illustrate the concepts. This material may be a level of abstraction above the working coder but is excellent for project managers and system architects. <i>--Stephen W. Plain</i></p><p> <b>Topics covered</b>: Browser/Server interactions, Web page design elements, session management, dynamic client and server languages, Web security, model design, use cases, requirement specifications, analysis, sequence diagrams, and class diagrams.</p><p> </p><p>This is a new edition of the widely acclaimed <i>Building Web Applications with UML</i>. Based on the author's extensive experience as a Web developer, it incorporates helpful reader feedback, identifies and addresses modeling problems unique to page-based Web applications, and offers practical advice and straightforward solutions.</p> <p>This thoroughly revised <i>Second Edition</i> reflects the latest techniques and issues surrounding the development of software and systems for the Web. You will find:</p> <ul> <li>Updated, expanded examples and diagrams</li> <li>Enhanced coverage of the latest Web application security concerns</li> <li>Detailed coverage of proven object technology concepts as applied to the development of Web applications</li> </ul> <p>Robust, scalable, and feature-rich Web applications are attainable. Using the industry-standard Unified Modeling Language (UML) to create designs allows Web application developers to easily integrate them with other systems modeled in UML.</p> <p>Written for project managers, architects, analysts, designers, and implementers, <b> <i>Building Web Applications with UML, Second Edition</i> </b>, demystifies the challenging aspects of modeling with the Web Application Extension (WAE) for the Unified Modeling Language. Because UML has been widely accepted as the standard language for modeling software systems, it is without question the best option for modeling Web application designs. The WAE extends the UML notation with semantics and constructs that empower you to model Web-specific architectural elements using the Rational Unified Process or an alternative methodology. Furthermore, using UML allows the modeling of Web applications as a part of the complete system and the integration of the business logic that must be reflected in each application.</p> <p>With this book as your guide, you will be able to gain a clear understanding of how to address the unique problems of modeling the design of page-based Web applications, and more important, how to take your model directly into working code.</p> <br> <br> 0201730383B08282002 <p></p></p><h2>The Visible Hand: The Managerial Revolution in American Business</h2><p><p> The role of large-scale business enterprise--big business and its managers--during the formative years of modern capitalism (from the 1850s until the 1920s is delineated in this pathmarking book. Alfred Chandler, Jr., the distinguished business historian, sets forth the reasons for the dominance of big business in American transportation, communications, and the central sectors of production and distribution. </p><p> The managerial revolution, presented here with force and conviction, is the story of how the visible hand of management replaced what Adam Smith called the invisible hand of market forces. Chandler shows that the fundamental shift toward managers running large enterprises exerted a far greater influence in determining size and concentration in American industry than other factors so often cited as critical: the quality of entrepreneurship, the availability of capital, or public policy. </p></p><p>The role of large-scale business enterprise-big business and its managers-during the formative years of modern capitalism is delineated for the first time in this pathmarking book.<b>Alfred D.

Part of its fascination and success is that in understanding other people&#39;s death rituals we are able to gain a better understanding of our own. Peter Metcalf and Richard Huntington refer to a wide variety of examples from different continents and epochs. They compare the great tombs of the Berawan of Borneo and the pyramids of Egypt, or the dramas of medieval French royal funerals and the burial alive of the Dinka &#34;masters of the spear&#34; in the Sudan, and other burials which at first sight seem to have little in common. Many of these cases are anthropological classics, and the authors use these examples partly in order to illustrate the many different ways in which anthropologists have tried to interpret these rites. A new introduction reviews theoretical developments in the anthropological study of death since the book first appeared in 1979.</p><p>This revised edition of a cross-cultural study of death rituals has become a standard text in anthropology, sociology, and religion.

To align with the IOM recommendations and to meet the new requirements for inclusion of a guideline in the National Guidelines Clearinghouse of the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ), American Psychiatric Association (APA) has adopted a new process for practice guideline development. Under this new process APA s practice guidelines also seek to provide better clinical utility and usability. Rather than a broad overview of treatment for a disorder, new practice guidelines focus on a set of discrete clinical questions of relevance to an overarching subject area. A systematic review of evidence is conducted to address these clinical questions and involves a detailed assessment of individual studies. The quality of the overall body of evidence is also rated and is summarized in the practice guideline. With the new process, recommendations are determined by weighing potential benefits and harms of an intervention in a specific clinical context. Clear, concise, and actionable recommendation statements help clinicians to incorporate recommendations into clinical practice, with the goal of improving quality of care. The new practice guideline format is also designed to be more user friendly by dividing information into modules on specific clinical questions. Each module has a consistent organization, which will assist users in finding clinically useful and relevant information quickly and easily. This new edition of the practice guidelines on psychiatric evaluation for adults is the first set of the APA s guidelines developed under the new guideline development process. These guidelines address the following nine topics, in the context of an initial psychiatric evaluation: review of psychiatric symptoms, trauma history, and treatment history; substance use assessment; assessment of suicide risk; assessment for risk of aggressive behaviors; assessment of cultural factors; assessment of medical health; quantitative assessment; involvement of the patient in treatment decision making; and documentation of the psychiatric evaluation. Each guideline recommends or suggests topics to include during an initial psychiatric evaluation. Findings from an expert opinion survey have also been taken into consideration in making recommendations or suggestions. In addition to reviewing the available evidence on psychiatry evaluation, each guideline also provides guidance to clinicians on implementing these recommendations to enhance patient care.</p><p></p><h2>Construction Scheduling: Principles And Practices</h2><p><p> <b> </b> This book is a comprehensive reference for project scheduling. It includes complete coverage of scheduling from the basics to advanced applications along with a detailed tutorial on the four most popular planning software programs&#x2014;Primavera Project Planner (P3), SureTrak, P3e/c, and Microsoft Project. <b> </b> Check lists, daily-to-do-lists, magnetic scheduling boards, bar charts, Critical Path Method in practical detail, short interval schedules, updating, resource management, earned value, linear scheduling, graphic schedules, and matrix schedules. <b> </b> Not only for project managers, schedulers, superintendents of construction firms, but also software developers, Information Technology project managers, military project managers, business management project managers, etc. </p></p><p><p> <b><i>Construction Scheduling: Principles and Practices</i></b> contains very comprehensive and practical descriptions of step-by-step procedures for preparing all types of schedules. The text's real-world approach reflects the author's many years of practice in the field. The use of the computer as the primary scheduling tool is shown in the extensive coverage given to the major software packages. </p><p> Anyone involved in the management of projects will find this text useful; however, it is written specifically for managers in the construction industry and students preparing for management positions. Therefore, the examples are construction related. However, this text would be extremely helpful to anyone in a project management position in manufacturing, engineering, computer and software design, technology, military or business management. </p> <p> The text contains comprehensive and practical information on the subject of scheduling, everything from checklists to the practical uses of CPM, including instructions on the four most popular project management software programs (Primavera Project Planner, SureTrak, Pie/c, and Microsoft Project). The text focuses on the basics of using the Critical Path Method (CPM) to plan and schedule projects and explains the use of CPM the way project managers use it. It is based on practical experience rather than research and theory. The emphasis is on managing a project rather than focusing on the details of CPM, getting lost in those details, and forgetting that the purpose of the schedule is to help manage and control a project. </p> <p> The techniques discussed have been used by project managers in a variety of projects, from throughout the nation and from students the author has taught for over 2 S years in a four-year construction management curriculum at a major university: The author has consulted with and provided inhouse training to over 150 construction companies and trained literally thousands of managers on these principles and techniques. </p> <p> The last four chapters in the book contain practical instructions on how to use Primavera Project Planner (P3), P3 a/c, SureTrak, and Microsoft Project. The software instructions are project driven, rather than software driven. The instructions are based on how managers use the software, rather than explaining every detail on every screen, in the order the screens appear. These chapters contain examples and assignments that teach how to use the software to communicate and manage the project. </p> <p> There is a CD included with the text that has example schedules for each of the software packages discussed. The CD also contains an automated checklist created with Microsoft Excel that some managers may find useful. In addition, the CD also contains an example bar chart created with Microsoft Excel. </p> <p> It is the author's sincere hope that the ideas and information contained in this book will be able to help project managers gain better control of their projects and thus their life. It is the author's desire that through the application of these ideas and techniques the manager will have more time to spend with family and loved ones rather than living at the project site. As managers of major projects we must learn and apply methods to improve the management of our projects without spending excessive hours each week doing so. It is time we learn to manage and control the project rather than allowing it to manage and control us. This book contains ideas to help us to work <i>smarter</i> so that we can play <i>harder.</i> </p> <p> Appreciation is expressed to my wife Sylvia and our six children: Jayson, Alisa, Jennifer (who edited the entire original manuscript), Chris, Jalyn, and Jarica for their support and patience during the writing of the text. </p> <p> Particular thanks are due to Dr. Neil Eldin, Texas A &amp; M University, Charles R. Glagola, University of Florida, and James Stein, Eastern Michigan University, for their assistance with the text review. </p> <p> As you read this text book and have any comments or suggestions, the author would be pleased to hear from you. For professors using the text, the sharing of a course syllabus would also be appreciated. </p> <p> Jay S.

Are you sick of memorising integrals? If so, real analysis could be your cup of tea. In contrast to calculus and elementary algebra, it involves neither formula manipulation nor applications to other fields of science. None. It is Pure Mathematics, and it is sure to appeal to the budding pure mathematician. In this new introduction to undergraduate real analysis the author takes a different approach from past studies of the subject, by stressing the importance of pictures in mathematics and hard problems. The exposition is informal and relaxed, with many helpful asides, examples and occasional comments from mathematicians like Dieudonne, Littlewood and Osserman. The author has taught the subject many times over the last 35 years at Berkeley and this book is based on the honours version of this course.

Each is well researched and insightful and offers powerful proposals. Stoknes explains why so many people have laissez-faire attitudes to dire predictions from the scientific community, and he reveals tactics employed by those wishing to conduct business as usual. He poses a clear blueprint for new ways to engage in global climate discussions. This reviewer notices that many journalists are adopting Stoknes&#x2019; designs&#x2015;evidently his ideas are becoming mainstream.

Read it soon. <strong>Summing Up</strong>: Essential. All readers.&#x201d;&nbsp;</p><br><br><p><strong><em>Library Journal</em>-</strong></p> <p>"Norwegian psychologist and economist Stoknes (<em>Money and Soul</em>) has produced a work about the psychological effects of global warming messages. While accepting dire facts and projections put forth by scientists, the author argues that their usual type of presentation is counterproductive. Providing audiences with abstract but scary information requiring sacrifice has produced apathy and denial among citizens of wealthy nations, the author says. Stoknes notes that there are social barriers against discussing the situation, and it can be politically divisive. However, ethics require all of us to find valid ways to combat climate disruption, he states, adding that we need to harness ancestral human drives to this task. Messaging needs to be simple, positive, and social to lead to mass behavioral change. The author commends movements such as Transition Town, which promotes community resilience and explains that the many inspiring stories about green innovation can help shift public attitudes over time. VERDICT:&nbsp;Stoknes has done a service for readers alarmed or concerned about global warming. He provides helpful strategies for accepting and dealing with their own reactions to the evidence, reducing carbon footprints, and influencing others to do likewise.&#x201d;</p><br><br><p><strong><em>Publishers Weekly</em>-</strong></p> <p>Stoknes (<em>Money and Soul</em>), a Norwegian psychologist and economist, addresses the polarized American debate over anthropogenic climate change, observing how it has devolved into 'a deteriorating and desperate spiral.' In this earnest and well-organized volume, he introduces a new aspect to the discussion, focusing not on the phenomenon&#x2019;s causes or consequences, but people&#x2019;s responses to it, including how they think, what they do, and how they live in the world. Stoknes puts a cognitive-psychological spin on the matter at hand and differentiates among climate 'skeptics,' &#x2018;contrarians,' and 'deniers,' distinguishing active and passive forms of denial. He also looks at evolutionary self-interest and the ways in which people can use social networks to further their goals. People like to believe their actions matter, he notes, and a solution is more likely to be implemented 'when people want it, like it, love it,' not when they are guilted or shamed into it. The more people 'see happy others conserve energy ... the more they are inclined to support ambitious climate policies on local, state, and national levels.' Framing the argument in this manner, Stoknes effectively combines talk of social psychology with environmental activism.&#x201d;</p><br><br><p>"Stoknes offers expert insights,&nbsp;drawn from the discipline of psychology and the art&nbsp;of storytelling,&nbsp;to the high-stakes quandary of our time: Why the response to climate change has not, yet, come close to matching the overwhelming magnitude and sophistication of the scientific evidence. He peels away the multiple layers of passivity-inducing narratives, and demonstrates how avoiding climate caricatures&#x2015;apocalypse on one hand, ecotopia on the other&#x2015;is the most effective way to prompt action. His alternative narratives, highlighting the many co-benefits of a switch away from fossil fuels, suggest a broad common ground across the ideological spectrum.&#x201d;<strong>--Mark Schapiro, author of <em>Carbon Shock: A Tale of Risk and Calculus on the Front Lines of a Disrupted Global Economy</em></strong></p><br><br><p>"Science is no longer the bottleneck to action on climate change. Why do we so often ignore, deny, and resist the science? Why aren&#x2019;t we outraged, demanding change? In a style both rigorous and personal, Per Espen Stoknes explains why, and more importantly, offers strategies for success. A pleasure to read, this book can help us all become more understanding, more committed, more effective&#x2015;and, along the way, more joyful."<strong>--John Sterman, professor, MIT Sloan School of Management, and author of&nbsp;<em>Business Dynamics: Systems Thinking and Modeling for a Complex World</em></strong></p><br><br><p>"Mahatma Gandhi&nbsp;said 'First they ignore you, then they laugh at you, then they fight you, then you win.' We&#x2019;re in this last phase but to win we need to change tactics, from using guilt to draw attention to instead using persuasion to change behavior and policy at a mass scale. Per Espen Stoknes shows the way with this brilliant description of how to go&nbsp;<em>with</em>&nbsp;rather than&nbsp;<em>against</em>&nbsp;the flow of human nature and thus shift society to action. There is no more important challenge facing society today and Stoknes's contribution is crucial.&#x201d;<strong>--Paul Gilding, author of <em>The Great Disruption</em></strong></p><br><br><p>"How, most effectively, to communicate the reality and ramifications of a slow-motion planetary meltdown? Whether you are a scientist or a CEO, an activist or a slacker, this book provides a simple toolkit for breaking down frozen attitudes. As a work that surveys a great deal of psychological research, it's at once accessible, practical, and &#x2013; in its last third &#x2013; richly reflective and evocative. In these concluding chapters Stoknes wrestles eloquently with the ways in which earthly calamity reverberates and sometimes wreaks havoc in any person&#x2019;s innermost sense of self and meaning."<strong>--David Abram, author of <em>The Spell of the Sensuous</em>&nbsp;</strong></p><br><br><p>"In a fresh and intimate voice Per Espen Stoknes navigates the obstacles and collective denial of&nbsp; climate change. Drawing on his own deep love of nature he suggests ways to overcome our &#x2018;Deep Grief&#x2019; by creating a spiritual connection with the air around us. In every way this is a book full of new perspectives and insights."<strong>--George Marshall, author of <em>Don't Even Think About It: Why Our Brains are Wired to Ignore Climate Change</em></strong></p><br><br><p>"Combining an entrepreneur&#x2019;s innovation with an economist&#x2019;s analytics and a psychologist&#x2019;s knowledge of human behavior, Per Espen Stoknes gives us a much-needed guide to moving beyond the politics and paralysis that generally cripple action on climate change, and provides us with concrete ways to inspire grounded hope for real climate solutions&#x201d;<strong>--Heidi Cullen, chief scientist, Climate Central</strong></p><br><br><p>"The human brain is poorly equipped to cope with mind-numbing problems like climate change.&nbsp;Per Espen Stoknes tell us why&#x2015;and then explains what we can do to change the way we think, act, and live.

The authors provide a unique combination of current concepts and practical applications. The important algorithms in 2D and 3D graphics are detailed for easy implementation.</p><p>"Interactive graphics is a field whose time has come. Until recently it was an esoteric specialty involving expensive display hardware, substantial computer resources, and idiosyncratic software. In the last few years, however, it has benefited from the steady and sometimes even spectacular reduction in the hardware price/performance ratio (e.g., personal computers for home or office with their standard graphics terminals), and from the development of high-level, device-independent graphics packages that help make graphics programming rational and straightforward. Interactive graphics is now finally ready to fulfill its promise to provide us with pictorial communication and thus to become a major facilitator of man/machine interaction." (From preface, Fundamentals of Interactive Computer Graphics, James Foley and Andries van Dam, 1982)<p>This assertion that computer graphics had finally arrived was made before the revolution in computer culture sparked by Apple's Macintosh and the IBM PC and its clones. Now even preschool children are comfortable with interactive-graphics techniques, such as the desktop metaphor for window manipulation and menu and icon selection with a mouse. Graphics-based user interfaces have made productive users of neophytes, and the desk without its graphics computer is increasingly rare.</p><p>At the same time that interactive graphics has become common in user interfaces and visualization of data and objects, the rendering of 3D objects has become dramatically more realistic, as evidenced by the ubiquitous computer-generated commercials and movie special effects. Techniques that were experimental in the early eighties are now standard practice, and more remarkable "photorealistic" effects are around the corner. The simpler kinds of pseudorealism, which took hours of computer time per image in the early eighties, now are done routinely at animation rates (ten or more frames/second) on personal computers. Thus "real-time" vector displays in 1981 showed moving wire-frame objects made of tens of thousands of vectors without hidden-edge removal; in 1990 real-time raster displays can show not only the same kinds of line drawings but also moving objects composed of as many as one hundred thousand triangles rendered with Gouraud or Phong shading and specular highlights and with full hidden-surface removal. The highest-performance systems provide real-time texture mapping, anitialiasing, atmospheric attenuation for fog and haze, and other advanced effects.</p><p>Graphics software standards have also advanced significantly since our first edition. The SIGGRAPH Core '79 package, on which the first edition's SGP package was based, has all but disappeared, along with direct-view storage tube and refresh vector displays. The much more powerful PHIGS package, supporting storage and editing of structure hierarchy, has become an official ANSI and ISO standard, and it is widely available for real-time geometric graphics in scientific and engineering applications, along with PHIGS+, which supports lighting, shading, curves, and surfaces. Official graphics standards complement lower-level, more efficient de facto standards, such as Apple's QuickDraw X Window System's Xlip 2D integer raster graphics package, and Silicon Graphics' GL 3D library. Also widely available are implementations of Pixar's RenderMan interface for photorealistic rendering and PostScript interpreters for hardcopy page and screen image description. Better graphics software has been used to make dramatic improvements in the "look and feel" of user interfaces, and we may expect increasing use of 3D effects, both for aesthetic reasons and for providing new metaphors for organizing and presenting, and navigating through information.</p><p>Perhaps the most important new movement in graphics is the increasing concern for modeling objects, not just for creating their pictures. Furthermore, interest is growing in describing the time-varying geometry and behavior of 3D objects. Thus graphics is increasingly concerned with simulation, animation, and a "back to physics" movement in both modeling and rendering in order to create objects that look and behave as realistically as possible.</p><p>As the tools and capabilities available become more and more sophisticated and complex, we need to be able to apply them effectively. Rendering is no longer the bottleneck. Therefore researchers are beginning to apply artificial-intelligence techniques to assist in the design of object models, in motion planning, and in the layout of effective 2D and 3D graphical presentations.</p><p>Today the frontiers of graphics are moving very rapidly, and a text that sets out to be a standard reference work must periodically be updated and expanded. This book is almost a total rewrite of the Fundamentals of Interactive Computer Graphics, and although this second edition contains nearly double the original 623 pages, we remain painfully aware of how much material we have been forced to omit.</p><p>Major differences from the first edition include the following:</p><p>The vector-graphics orientation is replaced by a raster orientation.</p><p>The simple 2D floating-point graphics package (SG) is replaced by two packages--SRGP and SPHIGS--that reflect the two major schools of interactive graphics programming. SRGP combines features of the QuickDraw and Xlib 2D integer raster graphics packages. SPHIGS, based on PHIGS, provides the fundamental features of a 3D floating-point package with hierarchical display lists. We explain how to do applications programming in each of these packages and show how to implement the basic clipping, scan conversion, viewing, and display list traversal algorithms that underlie these systems.</p><p>User-interface issues are discussed at considerable length, both for 2D desktop metaphors and for 3D interaction devices.</p><p>Coverage of modeling is expanded to include NURB (nonuniform rational B-spline) curves and surfaces, a chapter on solid modeling, and a chapter on advanced modeling techniques, such as physically based modeling, procedural models, factals, L-grammar systems, and particle systems.</p><p>Increased coverage of rendering includes a detailed treatment of antialiasing and greatly expanded chapters on visible-surface determination, illumination, and shading, including physically based illumination models, ray tracing, and radiosity.</p><p>Material is added on advanced raster graphics architectures and algorithms, including clipping and scan-conversion of complex primitives and simple image-processing operations, such as compositing.</p><p>A brief introduction to animation is added.</p><p>This text can be used by those without prior background in graphics and only some background in Pascal programming, basic data structures and algorithms, computer architecture, and simple linear algebra. An appendix reviews the necessary mathematical foundations. The book covers enough material for a full-year course, but is partitioned into groups to make selective coverage possible. The reader, therefore, can progress through a carefully designed sequence of units, starting with simple, generally applicable fundamentals and ending with more complex and specialized subjects.</p><p>Basic Group. Chapter 1 provides a historical perspective and some fundamental issues in hardware, software, and applications. Chapters 2 and 3 describe, respectively, the use and the implementation of SRGP, a simple 2D integer graphics package. Chapter 4 introduces graphics hardware, including some hints about how to use hardware in implementing the operations described in the preceding chapters. The next two chapters, 5 and 6, introduce the ideas of transformations in the plane and 3-space, representations by matrices, the use of homogeneous coordinates to unify linear and affine transformations, and the description of 3D views, including the transformations from arbitrary view volumes to canonical view volumes. Finally, Chapter 7 introduces SPHIGS, a 3D floating-point hierarchical graphics package that is a simplified version of the PHIGS standard, and describes its use in some basic modeling operations. Chapter 7 also discusses the advantages and disadvantages of the hierarchy available in PHIGS and the structure of applications that use this graphics package.</p><p>User Interface Group. Chapters 8-10 describe the current technology of interaction devices and then address the higher-level issues in user-interface design. Various popular user-interface paradigms are described and critiqued. In the final chapter user-interface software, such as window mangers, interaction technique-libraries, and user-interface management systems, is addressed.</p><p>Model Definition Group. The first two modeling chapters, 11 and 12, describe the current technologies used in geometric modeling: the representation of curves and surfaces by parametric functions, especially cubic splines, and the representation of solids by various techniques, including boundary representations and CSG models. Chapter 13 introduces the human color-vision system, various color-description systems, and conversion from one to another. This chapter also briefly addresses</p>The second edition of Fundamentals of Interactive Computer Graphics is completely rewritten to provide the most comprehensive, authoritative, and up-to-date coverage of the field. The authors provide a unique combination of current concepts and practical applications. The important algorithms in 2-D and 3-D graphics are detailed for easy implementation, including a close look at the more subtle special cases.<p> There is also a thorough presentation of the mathematical principles of geometric transformations and viewing. In this book, the authors explore multiple perspectives on the field of computer graphics: the user's, the application programmer's, the package implementor's, and the hardware designer's. There are over 100 full-color plates and over 700 figures illustrating the techniques presented in the book. Its many outstanding features ensure its position as the standard computer graphics reference for practitioners, and as a comprehensive and understandable text for students of all levels.</p><p>Systems Programming Series Software/SRGP/SPHIGS (Macintosh): 0-201-60956-8 Software/SRGP/SPHIGS (Windows): 0-201-60957-6</p></p><h2>1, 2, 3 John and Jude: Established in Truth ...

In all three editions, the purpose of this text has always remained the same: to enable students to approach literature from a variety of practical and theoretical perspectives and to equip them with a theoretical and a practical understanding of how critics develop their interpretations. Its overall aim is to take the mystery out of working with and interpreting texts. </p> <p> Like the first and second editions, the third edition holds to several key premises. First, I assume that there is no such thing as an "innocent" reading of a text. Whether our responses to a text are emotional and spontaneous or well reasoned and highly structured, all of our interpretations are based on underlying factors that cause us to respond in a particular way. What elicits these responses, and how a reader makes sense out of a text, is what really matters. It is the domain of literary theory to question our initial and all our further responses, our beliefs, our values, our feelings, and our eventual, overall interpretation. To understand why we respond to a text in a certain way, we must first understand literary theory and criticism. </p> <p> Second, since our responses to any text have theoretical bases, I presume that all readers have a literary theory. Consciously or unconsciously, as readers we have developed a mind-set that fits or encompasses our expectations when reading any text. Somehow we all seem able to make sense of a text. The methods we use to frame our personal and public interpretations directly involve us in the process of literary criticism and theory and automatically make us practicing literary critics, whether we know it or not! </p> <p> My third assumption rests on the observation that each reader's literary theory and accompanying methodology is either conscious or unconscious, complete or incomplete, informed or ill-informed, eclectic or unified. Since an unconscious, incomplete, ill-informed, and eclectic literary theory more frequently than not leads to illogical, unsound, and haphazard interpretations, I believe that a well-defined, logical, and clearly articulated theory will enable readers to develop their own methods of interpretation, permitting readers, in fact, to order, clarify, and justify their appraisals of a text in a consistent and rational manner. </p> <p> Unfortunately, many readers cannot articulate their own literary theory and have little knowledge of the history and development of the ever-evolving principles of literary criticism. It is the goal of this book to introduce such students to literary theory and criticism, its historical development, and the various theoretical positions or schools of criticism that will enable them as readers to make conscious, informed, and intelligent choices about their own methods of interpretation. </p> <p> Like the first two editions, this new edition introduces students to the basic concerns of literary theory in Chapter 1, which now includes a more expansive definition of <i>literature</i> itself. Chapter 2 places literary theory and criticism in historical perspective, starting with Plato and ending with modern-day theorists. Chapters 3 to 11 have all been revised, adding new terminology where appropriate. These chapters present the eleven major schools of criticism that have been developed in the twentieth century: New Criticism, Reader-Response Criticism, Structuralism, Deconstruction, Psychoanalytic Criticism, Feminism, Marxism, Cultural Poetics or New Historicism, and Cultural Studies, with an expanded discussion of Postcolonialism, including African American and Gender Studies. To maintain consistency and for ease of study, each of these chapters is identically organized. We begin with a brief <b>Introduction</b> followed by the <b>Historical Development</b> of each school of criticism. The <b>Assumptions</b> section, which sets forth the philosophical principles on which each school of criticism is based, is next. The <b>Methodology</b> section follows and serves as a "how-to" manual for explaining the techniques used by the various schools of criticism to formulate their interpretations of a text based upon their philosophical assumptions. All chapters in the third edition have received careful editing, with added terminology and scope of coverage. Throughout each of these sections, all <b>key terms</b> are in boldface type and are included in the new <b>Glossary</b> that appears at the back of this edition. </p> <p> After the Methodology section, there is an expanded <b>Questions for Analysis</b> section in 'Chapters 3 through 11. This feature provides students with key questions to ask of a text in order to view that text from the perspective of the school of criticism under discussion. Some of the questions also ask students to apply their new-found knowledge to a particular text. Following this section is the <b>Student Essay</b> introduction, which poses critical questions to prepare students to read the example essay at the end of the Chapter. As in the first two editions, this undergraduate <b>Student Essay</b> provides an example for analysis, in which a student applies the principles and methods of interpretation of the school of criticism under discussion to one of nine primary texts in the <b>Literary Selections.</b> All of these primary texts can be found at the back of this edition. </p> <p> Following the Student Essay warm-up is an updated <b>Further Reading</b> section. More comprehensive than in the first two editions, these selected references complement the more extensive <b>References</b> section found at the end of the text. After the Further Reading section, an updated <b>Web Sites</b> section appears that provides additional avenues of exploration for each of the schools of criticism. It is often the case that these World Wide Web addresses include links to other sites, thus providing opportunities to venture into the ever-expanding world of literary theory. </p> <p> Since <i>Literary Criticism</i> is an introductory text, the explanations of the various schools of criticism should not be viewed as exhaustive but as a first step toward an understanding of some rather difficult concepts, principles, and methodologies. Similarly, the student essays should not be viewed as literary masterpieces but as undergraduate attempts to employ differing literary theories. Instructors and students alike should feel free to critique these essays and explore both their strengths and weaknesses. After reading each of the chapters in this new edition, it is hoped that readers will continue their own investigations of literary theory by exploring advanced theoretical texts and the primary works of both theoretical and practical critics. </p></p><h2>Remington: The Science and Practice of Pharmacy (2 Volumes)</h2><p>For more than 100 years, Remington has been the definitive pharmacy reference.

Students sit with copies of the text before practicals searching for information. It is evident that my students see Remington as a trusted source because they will quote Remington in meetings for case studies, labs and in lectures...My overall impression of 22 is very positive, I feel the editor and authors have updated the text in line with developments in pharmaceutics with important sections on the biopharmaceutics classification system and modern drug discovery sections. Based on my reading of the text over the last month i&#39;ve noticed that the authors have given us some details of what direction research might be leading towards and so this text might also be recommended to research scientists...When students ask me I recommend Remington above all other books&#34; Dr Sam Maher, Lecturer in Pharmaceutics, RCSI. 9 November 2012. &#34;The 22nd edition of one of the most respected and comprehensive references in the field of pharmacy for the past 100 years manages to balance the traditional aspects of pharmacy with the expanding needs of current clinical pharmacists...This edition has undergone significant changes to maintain relevancy, adding new chapters organising drug monographs for better accessibility...this is a key reference for pharmacy students, researchers, pharmacists, and clinicians...Chapters on topics such as the drug approval process and pharmaceutical calculations are useful for students just learning as well as pharmacists looking to review these areas...This edition succeeds at providing information for a variety of readers, including students, researchers, and clinicians alike. Score - 5 stars.&#34; Melissa M. Ranieri, BS, PharmD, Doody&#39;s Notes, November 2012. &#34;As a student, the science of pharmacy volume is invaluable as a quick reference source, as well as a useful basis for an essay, lab report or other university work...The practice section is also very relevant for students, as well as the wider pharmacy world, as a good reference source for anything from pharmacists and public health, to professional communications or patient care...as it covers so many topics, and comes with free online access, I think it&#39;s good value for money.&#34; Charlotte Goodwin, British Pharmaceutical Students Association, October 2012.</p><h2>The Age of Innocence (Everyman&#39;s Library)</h2><p><p><i>The Age of Innocence</i>, one of Edith Wharton&#x2019;s most renowned novels and the first by a woman to win the Pulitzer Prize, exquisitely details the struggle between love and responsibility through the experiences of men and women in Gilded Age New York.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The novel follows Newland Archer, a young, aristocratic lawyer engaged to the cloistered, beautiful May Welland. When May&#x2019;s disgraced cousin Ellen arrives from Europe, fleeing her marriage to a Polish Count, her worldly, independent nature intrigues Archer, who soon falls in love with her. Trapped by his passionless relationship with May and the social conventions that forbid a relationship with Ellen, Archer finds himself torn between possibility and duty.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Wharton&#x2019;s profound understanding of her characters&#x2019; lives makes the triangle of Archer, May, and Ellen come to life with an irresistible urgency. A wry, incisive look at the ways in which love and emotion must negotiate the complex rules of high society, <i>The Age of Innocence</i> is one of Wharton's finest, most illuminative works.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>With an introduction by Peter Washington</p></p><p>Somewhere in this book, Wharton observes that clever liars always come up with good stories to back up their fabrications, but that really clever liars don't bother to explain anything at all. This is the kind of insight that makes <i>The Age of Innocence </i> so indispensable. Wharton's story of the upper classes of Old New York, and Newland Archer's impossible love for the disgraced Countess Olenska, is a perfectly wrought book about an era when upper-class culture in this country was still a mixture of American and European extracts, and when "society" had rules as rigid as any in history.Cambridge Literature is a series of literary texts edited for study by students aged 14-18 in English-speaking classrooms.

As a result, when the Spanish Armada attacked, England went down defeated, changing the history of Europe and the New World as we know it.<br><br>Now, in the Twentieth Century, the Church of Rome reigns supreme over a world of pastoral beauty, while technology is held back to the level of the steam locomotive and the primitive radio. Yet science cannot be suppressed forever, and its advocates are becoming more daring as each year passes. A revolution is building&#x2014;one that will rock the foundations of an empire. An acknowledged classic of alternate history fiction, Pavane will continue to inspire writers and readers for generations . . .<br></p><p>An ever-expanding subgenre of science fiction is devoted to "alternate worlds" or "alternate histories": fiction in which a crucial event goes differently than in the world we know, and history is changed. Keith Roberts's <i>Pavane</i> (1968) is set in a backward 20th century molded by the assassination of Queen Elizabeth I and the triumph of a militantly antiscience Catholic Church. This is a classic alternate history, in the same company as such highly regarded novels as L. Sprague De Camp's seminal <i>Lest Darkness Fall</i> (1941), in which a modern man slips back in time and attempts to avert the Dark Ages; Ward Moore's <i>Bring the Jubilee</i> (1953), set after the South wins the U.S. Civil War; and Philip K. Dick's <i>The Man in the High Castle</i> (1962), set after the Germans and Japanese win World War II. <i>Lest Darkness Fall</i> and <i>The Man in the High Castle</i> are justly famous; the other two classics, <i>Bring the Jubilee</i> and <i>Pavane</i>, are less well known, and that is a shame.<p> One reason for <i>Pavane</i>'s relative obscurity among American SF readers might be its British setting and author (the Moore and Dick novels are both set in the U.S., and De Camp, Moore, and Dick were all American). Another reason might be that <i>Pavane</i> is a novel created from interrelated but standalone stories (six "measures," or novelettes, and a coda), and the stories are of varying quality. Most are wise, beautifully written, and intensely visualized, especially the opener, "The Lady Margaret," and the closer, "Corfe Gate"; but "Brother John," the story of the monk-artist who witnesses Inquisition tortures and sparks an anti-Church rebellion, is far less detailed, and sometimes even unclear. Another reason for the novel's obscurity may be that some of the stories/chapters have more of a fantasy feel than is typical of more recent alternate history. Also, the nature of the coda's revelations may put off some readers. Nonetheless, <i>Pavane</i> is an intelligent, powerful, and moving work, deserving of a wide readership. <i>--Cynthia Ward</i></p>Keith Roberts started his career as an illustrator and cartoon animator. He published his first science fiction short stories in Science Fantasy in 1964, and in 1965 became associate editor of the magazine.

The war ended in total victory for Chile, and that country's emergence thereafter as 'the Prussia of South America', while it cost Peru a lucrative province, and Bolivia its outlet to the Pacific coast.</p></p><p>Gabriele Esposito is an Italian native, and a long-time student of South American wars.

Painting, scraping, repainting, and texturing are all part of Louise Fishman&#x2019;s artistic process. Her resulting works feel at once energetic and orderly, celebratory and reverent. This book accompanies the first-ever museum survey of Fishman&#x2019;s largescale gestural abstractions as well as a concurrent exhibition devoted to the artist&#x2019;s lesser-known work in small-scale painting and sculpture. Chronologically tracing her creative path over 50 years, the book explores how in the 1960s and &#x2019;70s she negotiated the constraints established by the male-dominated Abstract Expressionists to make for herself an adventurous and deeply personal painting practice. Full-color images trace a distinct transformation in Fishman&#x2019;s work&#x2015;from minimalist grid overlays to more chaotic representations, to the textured use of ashes and beeswax, to her majestic gestural works of recent years. This volume also includes insightful essays that delve into Fishman&#x2019;s relationship with the Abstract Expressionist, feminist, and Jewish communities. Beautifully produced to enhance Fishman&#x2019;s vibrant, multilayered works in the context of modern and contemporary art, this volume will be appreciated for its subject&#x2019;s wide-ranging appeal as an artist and a trailblazer.</p><p>Helaine Posner is Chief Curator of Contemporary Art at the Neuberger Museum of Art, SUNY Purchase."The book's text...sheds new light on [Louise Fishman's] work and worldview." <p> <i>Bookforum</i></p><br><br>"Insightful essays by the Neuberger&#x2019;s chief curator, Helaine Posner; critic Nancy Princenthal; and painter Carrie Moyer; together with curator Ingrid Schaffner&#x2019;s interview with the artist, reveal how Fishman redefined the traditionally masculine Abstract Expressionist tradition." <p> <i>Women in the Arts</i></p><br><br>"Until now, there has not been a proper reflective monograph dedicated to Louise Fishman, which is surprising given the American-born artist is a tour de force in the world of abstract painting, particularly in regards to her large-scale gestural abstractions.

(They also use a more dynamic, cinematic style.) In the case of the X-Men, that meant reconfiguring Professor Xavier's opening roster to include Cyclops, a punk Jean Grey, Beast, Ice Man, Colossus, Storm, and a psychopathic secret weapon named Wolverine. In the first of the two six-issue story arcs, <i>The Tomorrow People</i>, we meet the team and their mission to protect the human race against Magneto and his Brotherhood of Evil Mutants, whose desire to establish homo superior's proper place above normal humanity leads the U.S. President to deploy the mutant killing machines, the Sentinels. The second arc, <i>Return to Weapon X</i> sags a little by deemphasizing the team in favor of the government agents behind the Weapon X project.

To the student and scholar of Kant's thought, the Logic can shed new and interesting light on logic, aesthetics, and moral reasoning. </strong></p><p><p><strong>Immanuel Kant (1724-1804) has been caricatured as a stiff German professor, whose Stoic habits were so predictable that the people of K�nigsberg, his hometown, could set their clocks by his daily walks. Kant's life is best described as a heroic struggle to discover order within chaos or, better, an effort to fix human thought and behavior within it proper limits. He lived and worked during the Enlightenment, a time when political, religious, and intellectual freedom erupted across the Western world.</strong></p><p>INTRODUCTION</p><p>While Immanuel Kant is certainly one of the most original and influential thinkers of the modern period, he is also among the most opaque. This opacity is grounded, in part, in the profundity of his philosophical ideas and, in part, in his less-than-clear presentation. What makes Kant&#x2019;s <i>Introduction to Logic</i> truly unique in the context of his other works is both the breadth of the subject matter and the clarity of the discussions. This little book might just as well have been entitled <i>An Introduction to Kant&#x2019;s Thought</i>, for in it he deals with all of the major issues that had concerned him in his more popular works. Yet his presentation here is far less technical and convoluted and thus far more accessible. For the novice it can serve as an excellent introduction to Kant&#x2019;s entire philosophy, a philosophy that is generally overwhelming when approached from any of his other books. To the student and scholar of Kant&#x2019;s thought, the <i>Logic</i> can shed new and interesting light on some enduring problems and issues.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Immanuel Kant was born in K�nigsberg, East Prussia (now Kaliningrad, Russia), on April 22, 1724, the fourth of nine children. His father, Johann Georg, a harness maker, provided the family a modest material existence while his mother, Anna Regina Reuter, seems to have been the source of the family&#x2019;s spiritual sustenance through her commitment to Pietism, i.e., a form of Protestantism that emphasized the inner workings of faith and personal commitment over organized religion and doctrine. She was a devotee and acquaintance of F. A. Schultz (1692&#x2013;1763), a professor at the University of Halle and the chief representative of the Pietist movement. Schultz was also the director of the <i>Collegium Fridericianum</i>, a quality high school modeled on the University of Halle. Thus, perhaps owing to his mother&#x2019;s connections and persuasions, young Immanuel was admitted to this prestigious institution in 1732, at the age of eight.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In 1740 Kant entered the University of K�nigsberg as a theological student, but he soon became enamored of mathematics and physics, especially the work of Sir Isaac Newton. To support himself he served as a private tutor from 1746 to 1755. For the next fifteen years he held the position of <i>Privatdocent</i> (lecturer), during which time his popularity as a teacher increased and his research interests expanded. Although Kant had been raised a Pietist, he, like most writers of the mid-eighteenth century<i>,</i> had been educated and indoctrinated in the philosophy of G. W. Leibniz (1646&#x2013;1716) and that of his student and expositor, Christian Wolff (1679&#x2013;1754). During the 1760s, however, he became increasingly critical of the &#x201c;dogmatism&#x201d; that characterized the Leibniz-Wolffian approach then prevalent in German universities. </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In 1770 Kant was appointed to the chair of logic and metaphysics at the University of K�nigsberg, and so began the most productive period of his career. His chief works of this period were the <i>Kritik der reinen Vernunft </i>(<i>Critique of Pure Reason</i>, 1781), a treatise that revolutionized metaphysics; <i>Grundlegung zur Metaphysik der Sitten</i> (<i>Foundations of the Metaphysics of Morals</i>, 1785), one the most important contributions to moral philosophy ever written; the <i>Kritik der praktischen Vernunft</i> (<i>Critique of Practical Reason</i>, 1788), another important source of his ethical views; and the <i>Kritik der Urtheilskraft</i> (<i>Critique of Judgment</i>, 1790), a book on teleological and aesthetic judgments<i>.</i> Kant died on February 12, 1804. According to the accounts of those present at his deathbed, his last words were, &#x201c;Es ist gut&#x201d;&#x2014;&#x201c;It is good.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The present book comprises two of Kant&#x2019;s works. The first is the <i>Introduction to Logic</i>. The second is a short essay published in 1762, entitled, <i>Die falsche Spitzfindigkeit der vier syllogistischen Figuren erwiesen </i>(<i>The False Subtlety of the Four Syllogistic Figures</i>), in which Kant takes on the long and revered tradition of Aristotelian logic. </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Kant&#x2019;s <i>Introduction to Logic</i> might well be described as the best book in his <i>corpus</i> that he didn&#x2019;t write, and the most readable book that most Kant students almost never read. That Kant didn&#x2019;t write the book <i>per se</i> is not to deny him either authorship or ownership of the ideas contained therein. From 1755 through 1796, Kant taught logic at least once a year using Georg Friedrich Meier&#x2019;s textbook, <i>Auszug aus der Vernunftlehre</i> (<i>Extract from the Theory of Reason,</i> Halle, 1752). Kant presented his textbook to his friend and student, Gottlob Benjamin J�sche, along with its marginalia and loose-leaf notes, to forge into the present work, which was published in 1800. That the book goes largely unread by students of Kant&#x2019;s philosophy is truly unfortunate. For it is in fact a treasure trove of ideas and information presented in a much less formal fashion than that of his published works.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The stylistic simplicity of Kant&#x2019;s <i>Logic</i> has led many scholars to treat the essay with some skepticism with respect to authorship. However, since the work was put together from the &#x201c;lecture notes&#x201d; on Kant&#x2019;s logic course, it really shouldn&#x2019;t come as any surprise that it lacks the tedious argumentation and tortuous syntax that typify some of his published works, and that it reflects the straightforward presentation and accessible technique that were said to be characteristics of his lectures. He did, after all, have more than forty years of teaching the material to hone and polish his presentation.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Among the many topics dealt with in this cornucopia of ideas, there are six areas of discussion that are of particular interest. These are: (1) <i>logic</i>; (2)<b> </b><i>metaphysics and epistemology</i>; (3) (the nature and history of) <i>philosophy</i>; (4)<b> </b><i>aesthetics</i>; (5) <i>moral reasoning</i>; and what we might call (6) <i>commonsense advice</i>.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>(1) <i>Logic</i>. Since his essay of 1762, Kant had entertained some peculiar ideas with regard to logic, which were ultimately developed and expressed in the &#x201c;doctrine of elements&#x201d; presentation in the <i>Critique of Pure Reason</i> (and, in fact, in each of the other two <i>Critiques</i>). Since the present volume was largely composed during the development of Kant&#x2019;s Critical philosophy, it is not surprising to find it reflecting those positions. Logic is understood to be &#x201c;a canon of the understanding and of reason . . . [containing] nothing but <i>a priori</i> laws, which are necessary, and apply to the understanding universally&#x201d; (p. 3). He then goes on to distinguish various misapplications of logic: e.g., <i>dialectical</i> (or &#x201c;sophistical&#x201d;), <i>popular</i> and <i>scientific</i>, <i>applied</i>, <i>commonsense</i> and <i>speculative</i> uses, which in each case add contents and thus, distort and destroy its purely formal character. The primary role of logic is &#x201c;to teach the correct use of reason, that is, the use which is consistent with itself.&#x201d; Its purpose is to show us how the understanding &#x201c;ought to proceed in thinking&#x201d; (p. 4.).</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>(2) <i>Metaphysic and Epistemology</i>. Besides general logic, Kant&#x2019;s <i>Logic</i> also provides some interesting insights into his metaphysical and epistemic doctrines. &#x201c;<i>Transcendental</i> Logic,&#x201d; he tells us, is that &#x201c;in which the object itself is conceived as an object of the understanding alone; whereas general Logic applies to all objects universally&#x201d; (p. 5). In other words, general logic expresses the necessary laws in terms of which <i>any rational being</i> whatsoever must rationally function. Transcendental logic, on the other hand, expresses the necessary laws in terms of which <i>human beings</i> must experience and rationally function within the world. Section V (pp. 24&#x2013;30) contains the most straightforward account of the origin of our (human) cognition to be found anywhere in Kant&#x2019;s writings. What it lacks in depth it makes up for in clarity. Finally in this context is Kant&#x2019;s interesting account of the seven degrees of knowledge we have of things (pp. 55&#x2013;56), which moves from the lowest stage, of merely having &#x201c;an idea of a thing,&#x201d; to the highest stage, whereby we &#x201c;<i>comprehend</i> a thing, that is, to cognize it by the reason, or <i>a priori</i>, in such a degree as is adequate to our purpose&#x201d; (p. 55).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>(3) <i>Philosophy</i>. For Kant, philosophy is both a rational knowledge and a skill. Yet, a philosopher is much more than a conceptual technician. To become a philosopher one must &#x201c;exercise himself in making a free use of his reason, not a mere imitative and, so to speak, mechanical use&#x201d; (p. 13). To improve one&#x2019;s rational skills through, for example, the study of logic, is the <i>scholastic conception</i> of philosophy. To consider the so-called higher questions, such as the purpose of human existence, the nature of reality, etc., is the <i>cosmic conception</i> of philosophy, the one that gives the discipline its dignity. It is only through the unity of these two conceptions that true wisdom is to be obtained. To the question, &#x201c;Can philosophy be learned?&#x201d; Kant, interestingly, gives an emphatic no. The reason it cannot be learned is that &#x201c;<i>it does not exist</i>&#x201d; (p.16). The history of philosophy is simply &#x201c;the history of the use of reason,&#x201d; and the doctrines and views contained therein are nothing more than &#x201c;objects for the exercise of [one&#x2019;s] philosophical ability&#x201d; (Ibid.). The true philosopher (i.e., &#x201c;one who knows and teaches Wisdom&#x201d;) must, &#x201c;as an independent thinker, make a free and independent, not a slavishly imitative, use of his reason&#x201d; (Ibid.). This discussion does much to dispel the caricature of Kant as a dry, withered-up old formalist (an image created in the nineteenth century by the poet Heinrich Heine). </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>(4) <i>Aesthetics</i>. In Section I, Kant distinguishes sharply between logic, as a set of <i>a priori</i> rules of the understanding and reason, and <i>aesthetics</i>, which he here describes as &#x201c;the rules of the agreement of knowledge with the laws of the sensibility&#x201d; (p. 5). Aesthetics is described as &#x201c;criticism,&#x201d; or a set of <i>a posteriori</i> rules culled from experience, which may serve to guide us in our evaluation of artistic beauty. Yet, as in the <i>Critique of Judgment</i>, Kant acknowledges the possibility of something he calls an &#x201c;<i>aesthetically</i> perfect&#x201d; cognition, i.e., Beauty (p. 27). Here, as in the third Critique, he suggests that while we may disagree about <i>what</i> is beautiful, we must agree that everyone, everywhere acknowledges <i>that</i> something is beautiful.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>(5) <i>Moral Reasoning</i>. In considering the &#x201c;horizons&#x201d; of our knowledge, Kant suggests, as he had in the <i>Critique of Practical Reason</i>, that there is a practical determination with respect to the human will which &#x201c;is of the greatest importance&#x201d; (p. 31). The contrast here between &#x201c;logical&#x201d; (or &#x201c;theoretical&#x201d;) and &#x201c;practical&#x201d; reason is developed later on in Section IX, in his distinction between &#x201c;knowledge&#x201d; and &#x201c;belief,&#x201d;&nbsp; respectively. <i>Knowledge</i> is &#x201c;assent from a reason which is both subjectively and objectively adequate&#x201d; (p. 61). It can be derived either through reason (<i>a priori</i> knowledge) or through experience (<i>a posteriori</i> knowledge). <i>Belief</i>, however, is something very different. It is intimately related to action, to the will. The postulates of Kant&#x2019;s moral system&#x2014;freedom, God, and an immortal soul&#x2014;cannot be known through theoretical reason. Yet, morality, he insists, requires them. And <i>practical reason</i> provides them, <i>via</i> rational belief: &#x201c;Rational belief, then, can never reach to theoretical knowledge. . . . .[I]t is only a supposition of the reason in a subjective but absolutely necessary practical point of view&#x201d; (p. 60).</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>(6) <i>Commonsense Advice</i>. This discussion involves the kinds of insights that one might have gotten while having coffee with Kant. The issues addressed here merely scratch the surface of this remarkable little book. <i>What use is pure science</i>? He tells us that, &#x201c;[e]very logically perfect cognition has always some possible use which, although as yet unknown to us, may perhaps be discovered by posterity&#x201d; (p.32). <i>What is the value of speculative knowledge</i>? To this he responds that knowledge has its own intrinsic value: &#x201c;Our understanding . . . is so constituted that it finds satisfaction in mere insight, and even more than in the resulting utility. . . . Man feels in this his own excellence. . . . Men who do not feel this must envy the beasts&#x201d; (p. 33). <i>How should one&#x2019;s knowledge, one&#x2019;s education, generally proceed</i>? Kant provides eight rules for enlarging and improving one&#x2019;s knowledge (pp. 33&#x2013;34), and goes on to delineate various errors of learning (pedantry, dilettantism, etc.). This discussion culminates in his instructions on how to be&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;truly popular&#x201d; (hint&#x2014;&#x201c;read the ancients&#x201d;) (p. 38). <i>How can we avoid errors in judgments</i>? He offers three rules to help us avoid errors: think for ourselves; be able to think from the perspectives of others; and think consistently. Just as important, rely on common sense. &#x201c;Common sense . . . is also in itself a touchstone for detecting the errors of the <i>technical</i> use of the understanding&#x201d; (p. 48). <i>What kind of erroneous judgment presents the greatest danger to our knowledge</i>? Judging by the extent of the discussion, Kant&#x2019;s answer would appear to be <i>prejudice</i> (cf. pp. 65&#x2013;71). &#x201c;Every prejudice is to be viewed as a principle of erroneous judgment, and from prejudices arise not prejudices, but erroneous judgments&#x201d; (p. 66). He contends that prejudice arises through imitation (we accept as true what is commonly regarded as true), custom (we accept as true a belief that has been accepted for a long time) and inclination (it is easier to believe what others believe than to believe otherwise). Kant&#x2019;s discussion here is as fresh and enlightening as it was when it was written.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The second piece contained in the present volume is Kant&#x2019;s early and very technical essay, <i>The False Subtlety of the Four Syllogistic Figures</i>, published in 1762. Here Kant strikes out against the well-entrenched system of Aristotelian logic. To appreciate his criticisms we must first understand something about the system itself.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>According to this system, a basic argument can be translated into a <i>categorical syllogism</i>; that is, an argument consisting of two <i>premises</i> and a <i>conclusion</i>. The premises are statements that are <i>assumed</i> to be true, whereas the conclusion is a statement that is <i>inferred</i> from these premises. Consider, for example, the following argument:</p><p>&nbsp;</p></p><h2>The Parables of Kryon</h2><p>This story relates to individual human beings and how they react in specific circumstances, showing how they are filled with penetrating insights.</p><p>Kryon is a multiple inter-dimensional entity. After graduating with a business and economics degree from California Western University in California, Lee Carroll started a technical audio business in San Diego that flourished for 30 years. As an engineer, where do channelling and Indigo children fit into all this? As Lee tells it, God had to hit him &#34;between the eyes&#34; to prove his spiritual experience was real. The year 1989 was the turning point when the first psychic told him about his spiritual path, and then three years later when the second unrelated psychic told him the same thing! Timidly, the first writings were presented to the metaphysical community in Del Mar, California, and the rest is history-a total of nine metaphysical books were released in a seven-year span. There are now over a half a million books in print in 14 languages: Spanish, French, German, Chinese, Hebrew, English, Danish, Italian, Greek, Hungarian, Japanese, and Turkish. Also represented are the languages of the Netherlands and Finland. Lee and his spiritual partner, Jan Tober, started the &#34;Kryon light groups&#34; in Del Mar in 1991 and quickly moved from a living-room setting to a Del Mar church. Now they&#39;re hosting meetings all over the globe, with audiences of up to 3,000 people in Europe alone. In the beginning days of the Internet, Kryon had the largest consistent New Age folder in the history of America Online, and now attracts many more electronic browsers on his Website, which you can visit at [www.kryon.com]. Also on the Website is an on-line magazine where new Kryon and Indigo-related articles are featured regularly. Perhaps the most moving meeting with Jan and Lee occurred in Tel Aviv, Israel, in October 2000. Amid the strife and violent uprisings at that time in the Middle East, messages were given to a single group of more than 1,000 Israelites that were uplifting and positive. (This message is available on the Kryon Website, listed above.) In 1995, Lee and Jan were asked to present the Kryon work at the United Nations (U.N.) in New York City before a U.N.-chartered group known as the Society for Enlightenment and Transformation (S.E.A.T.). The meeting was so well accepted that they were invited back two more times, in 1996 and in 1998, to present their message of love! Lee is the author of nine Kryon books, and is the co-author (along with Jan) of The Indigo Children: The New Kids Have Arrived. Lee continues to write from his home in San Diego, living with his wife, Patricia, and his Maltese dog, Mini.</p><h2>With No One as Witness</h2><p>When the Metropolitan Police fail to realise a serial killer is at work, London ignites over the fact that the killer&#39;s victims are young black and mixed race boys.

Michael Baughman has fished these waters most of his life, and A River Seen Right is his testament to what he has learned there.The North Umpqua flows past thousands of years of history, with three-thousand-year-old bird points still able to be found at the water's edge. In the twentieth century, renowned sportsmen such as Zane Grey have come to the river, tramping up the steps of the famed Steamboat Inn, whose history is detailed here. There are some candid words on the danger of increased fishing pressure on the viability of the fishery. The book speaks of fly patterns, productive pools, and the best seasons to fish (mostly the uncrowded ones), but its bent is not practical. Rather, Baughman brings us along on an extended tour of the river to talk about fishing, the river's rich history, and some pleasant memories - like an afternoon's walk at streamside with an old friend.The book is graced with photographs by Dan Callaghan, who is also lucky enough to call the North Umpqua his home water.Any fly fisherman, from any place, will want this special book.

Rey, Curious George has found a lasting place in the hearts of millions of young readers worldwide. Readers of Spanish will be entertained by the engaging exploits of the Popular Monkey in Jorge El Curioso, the Spanish translation of Curious George.<p>The Reys were born in Hamburg, Germany. Hans Augusto Rey (1898-1977) met his wife-to-be, Margret (1906-1996), at a party in her father&#x2019;s home in Germany; when he first caught a glimpse of her, she was sliding down the banister. In their twenties and thirties they lived in Paris and in Rio de Janeiro, where Hans sold bathtubs in villages along the Amazon River. Eventually Cambridge, Massachusetts, became the Reys&#x2019; home and community. Throughout their lives the Reys created many lively books together, including SPOTTY, PRETZEL, and lift-the-flap books such as HOW DO YOU GET THERE? The manuscript of the first Curious George books was one of the few items the Reys carried with them on their bicycles when they escaped from Paris in 1940. Eventually, they made their way to the United States, and CURIOUS GEORGE was published in 1941. Their incorrigible little monkey has become an American icon, selling millions of books and capturing the hearts of readers everywhere.

In this, the most important volume, Martin Gilbert probes beneath the surface of each of the crucial decisions in which Churchill was involved from the outbreak of war in September 1939 to the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor in December 1941. He reveals not only how each decision was reached but precisely what influences lay behind it, pieced together from an even more diverse documentary history than earlier volumes: documents Churchill sent and received, the diaries and letters of his private secretaries, the recollections of those who worked with him, as well as the records from the War Cabinet and other Government agencies. Events covered include the fall of France, the Dunkirk evacuation, the Battle of Britain, the crushing ordeal of the Blitz, the German conquest of Yugoslavia and Greece, the battle of the Atlantic, the hazardous struggle in Africa&#39;s desert, and Hitler&#39;s invasion of Russia. In public, Churchill&#39;s confidence was a tonic; but we see here how in private, realizing just how perilous the situation was in the summer of 1940, he came near to despair, waking up, as he later confided, &#34;with dread in my heart.&#34; 1304 pages with index.</p><p></p><h2>Roy&#39;s Feasts from Hawaii</h2><p>A feast for the eye and the palate, this is the ultimate presentation of the new cuisine from Hawaii and the Pacific Rim created by its most celebrated and honored chef, Roy Yamaguchi.

As he was able to do in <b>Schindler's List,</b> he shows us in <b>The Great Shame</b> a people despised and rejected to the point of death, who in the face of all their sorrows manage to keep their souls. This story of oppression, famine, and emigration--a principal chapter in the story of man's inhumanity to man--becomes in Keneally's hands an act of resurrection; Irishmen and Irishwomen of a century and a half ago live once more within the pages of this book."<br>--Thomas Cahill, author of <b>How the Irish Saved Civilization</b><br>In the nineteenth century, Ireland lost half of its population to famine, emigration to the United States and Canada, and the forced transportation of convicts to Australia. The forebears of Thomas Keneally, author of <b>Schindler's List</b>, were victims of that tragedy, and in <b>The Great Shame</b> Keneally has written an astonishing, monumental work that tells the full story of the Irish diaspora with the narrative grip and flair of a great novel. Based on unique research among little-known sources, this masterly book surveys eighty years of Irish history through the eyes of political prisoners--including Keneally's ancestors--who left Ireland in chains and eventually found glory, in one form or another, in Australia and America.<br><br>We meet William Smith O'Brien, leader of an uprising at the height of the Irish Famine, who rose from solitary confinement in Australia to become the Mandela of his age; Thomas Francis Meagher, whose escape from Australian captivity led to a glittering American career as an orator, a Union general, and governor of Montana; John Mitchel, who became a Confederate newspaper reporter, gave two of his sons to the Southern cause, was imprisoned with Jefferson Davis--and returned to Ireland to become mayor of Tipperary; and John Boyle O'Reilly, who fled a life sentence in Australia to become one of nineteenth-century America's leading literary lights.<br><br>Through the lives of many such men and women--famous and obscure, some heroes and some fools (most a little of both), all of them stubborn, acutely sensitive, and devastatingly charming--we become immersed in the Irish experience and its astonishing history. From Ireland to Canada and the United States to the bush towns of Australia, we are plunged into stories of tragedy, survival, and triumph. All are vividly portrayed in Keneally's spellbinding prose, as he reveals the enormous influence the exiled Irish have had on the English-speaking world.<br>"A terrible and personal saga, history delivered with a scholar's density of detail but with the individualizing power of a multi-talented novelist."<br>--William Kennedy</p><p>The Booker Prize-winning <i>Schindler's List</i> (on which Steven Spielberg based his Oscar-winning film) demonstrated that Thomas Keneally could make history as compelling as any novel. His latest book, <i>The Great Shame</i>, expands upon the achievement of his earlier fiction. This is more than just the story of the Keneally family tree, transported from Ireland to Australia in the 19th-century. It is the story of how Irish men and women came to be dispersed all over the world, and what they made of their lives in their new homes. It is the epic history of a whole people.<p> <i>The Great Shame</i> is hypnotically readable, partly because Keneally weaves his many narrative strands so expertly and touches his story with many moments of beautiful writing, but also because it is all, even at its most extraordinary, completely true. The result is astonishingly vivid. What <i>The Great Shame</i> most resembles is a classic 19th-century novel: Dickens, say, or George Eliot. Readers avidly follow Keneally's characters through their successes and their trials, until the very last sentence in the book when, like a master from the classic age of the novel, Keneally pays tribute to "the piquant blood and potent ghosts of the characters to whom we now bid goodbye." <i>--Adam Roberts</i></p>"A brave work whose narrative threads connect the personal, the political and the historical, leaving us with vivid impressions of 'Irish ghosts' in both triumph and tragedy.... It is important to retrieve these immigrant memories because they help us recover and define our identity."<br>--Tom Hayden, <i>The Los Angeles Times</i><br><br>"<b>The Great Shame</b> is an event, a broad-shouldered integration of personal and national history. As one would expect from this author, the writing is both flavorful and straightforward. Mr. Keneally never brandishes his accounts for their dramatic or cinematic effect. In the style of the best historians, he allows the intrinsic power of the tales he tells and the people who populate his pages to draw the reader into a fully elaborated universe.... <b>The Great Shame</b> puts a fully composed human face on political events and in doing so rises to a high level of humanistic achievement."<br>--Richard Bernstein, <i>New York Times</i><br><br>"Keneally breathes life and warmth into his Irish heroes...<b>The Great Shame</b> is an epic tale of courage and ingenuity."<br>--Jay P. Dolan, <i>New York Times Book Review</i><br><br>"Let a master like Thomas Keneally take on this dramatic and poignant chapter in history and it becomes something vivid and heartbreaking and very much alive...<b>The Great Shame</b> is a work of remarkable optimism: a story that reminds us how often human achievement is measured not in conquest or in riches but in simple survival against the odds."<br>--<i>Salon.com</i><br></p><h2>Our Inner Ape</h2><p><p><b>Visit the author's Web site at www.ourinnerape.com</b></p> <p>It&#x2019;s no secret that humans and apes share a host of traits, from the tribal communities we form to our irrepressible curiosity. We have a common ancestor, scientists tell us, so it&#x2019;s natural that we act alike. But not all of these parallels are so appealing: the chimpanzee, for example, can be as vicious and manipulative as any human.</p> <p>Yet there&#x2019;s more to our shared primate heritage than just our violent streak. In <b>Our Inner Ape</b>, Frans de Waal, one of the world&#x2019;s great primatologists and a renowned expert on social behavior in apes, presents the provocative idea that our noblest qualities generosity, kindness, altruism are as much a part of our nature as are our baser instincts. After all, we share them with another primate: the lesser-known bonobo. As genetically similar to man as the chimpanzee, the bonobo has a temperament and a lifestyle vastly different from those of its genetic cousin. Where chimps are aggressive, territorial, and hierarchical, bonobos are gentle, loving, and erotic (sex for bonobos is as much about pleasure and social bonding as it is about reproduction).</p> <p>While the parallels between chimp brutality and human brutality are easy to see, de Waal suggests that the conciliatory bonobo is just as legitimate a model to study when we explore our primate heritage. He even connects humanity&#x2019;s desire for fairness and its morality with primate behavior, offering a view of society that contrasts markedly with the caricature people have of Darwinian evolution. It&#x2019;s plain that our finest qualities run deeper in our DNA than experts have previously thought.</p> <p>Frans de Waal has spent the last two decades studying our closest primate relations, and his observations of each species in <b>Our Inner Ape</b> encompass the spectrum of human behavior. This is an audacious book, an engrossing discourse that proposes thought-provoking and sometimes shocking connections among chimps, bonobos, and those most paradoxical of apes, human beings.</p></p><p>Power, sex, violence and kindness: these four broad-spectrum categories encompass much of human behavior, so it's only fitting that they're also the primary subject material for Frans de Waal's (<i>The Ape and The Sushi Master</i>) book <i>Our Inner Ape</i>. The few (but deeply detailed) chapters are a mesmerizing read that spans biology, child psychology, postmodern theorists and fundamental morality, using tales of stern chimps, and sexy bonobos to examine humans' place between them. In the process, he examines why we need to know our place in the world, how our body language communicates feelings, and where the roots of empathy lie in mammalian life. <p> De Waal's respect for both his readers and his research subjects come shining through in the simple clarity he uses when describing both the endless sex of bonobo apes and the heartrending violence occasionally present in chimp hierarchal structure. By illustrating his points with a mixture of straight-from-research experiences and jokes at the expense of modern politicians, he keeps his ideas compelling for anyone with a basic understanding of evolutionary science without drifting towards the academic drone that could be expected of by a researcher of his experience. </p><p> You won't find specific conclusions concerning human nature, but instead a gentle, almost rambling look at two primate species with vastly different social networks and how, perhaps, humanity can learn from each to our benefit. A few of de Waal's lovely duotone photos (<i>My Family Album: 30 Years of Primate Photography</i> grace the end of the book, featuring close-up shots of the folks he's been writing about--chimps like Yeroen, Nikkie and Mama, and bonobo Kuif and adopted daughter Roosje are downright thrilling to see after reading such interesting stories about their lives. <i>Jill Lightner</i></p>Frans de Waal, Ph.D., is the author of five previous books, which have been translated into fourteen languages, including <i>The Ape and the Sushi Master</i>, a <i>New York Times</i> Notable Book, and <i>Peacemaking Among Primates</i>, winner of the <i>Los Angeles Times</i> Book Award.

Thus begins this harrowing dual memoir that braids the story of Chinese-American Pang-Mei's own search for identity with the dramatic tale of her great-aunt, Chang Yuyi, born at the turn of the century in tradition-bound China. In alternating voices, Pang-Mei captivates the reader as she tells the story of Yuyi's battle with her mother to stop the painful foot-binding process, the first in a series of rebellions that marked her extraordinary life. This deeply textured portrait of Chinese life in the perilous years between the fall of the last emperor and the Communist Revolution captures, above all, the struggle of fiercely independent women emerging from centuries of customs and ideals, both subtle and pronounced.<br><br>In pitch-perfect prose and vivid detail, <i>Bound Feet And Western Dress</i> is about the power of storytelling as Yuyi confides her innermost dreams and demons with her brilliant and assimilated American-born niece in this splendiferous literary debut.</p><p>When Chang Yu-I was three her mother tried to bind her feet. But the child's cries so tormented her brother that he convinced their mother to stop. This break with convention foreshadowed the extraordinary life Yu-i was to lead. After following her husband, poet Hsu Chi-Mo, a noted philanderer, to Oxford, she made history by becoming the first Chinese woman to have a western-style divorce at age 22. Determined to make her own way, she moved to America and served in a series of prestigious positions, including president of a bank. Written by Yu-i's great niece, Pang-Mei Natasha Chang, <b>Bound Feet and Western Dress</b> chronicles the life of this exceptional woman.Pang-Mei Natasha Chang was raised in Connecticut. She received her B.A. in Chinese Studies from Harvard and a J.D. degree from Columbia University School of Law. She practiced law in New York City before moving to Moscow, where she currently resides with her husband. <i>Bound Feet and Western Dress</i> is her first book.</p><h2>Mandarin Plaid</h2><p>It's a long way from the cramped, dreary sweatshops where Lydia Chin's mother once sewed for the heady world of fashion. But in New York City, worlds collide. And a petite, Chinese-American P.I. can still rub shoulders with the rich, the poor, the beautiful, and the depraved. <br><br>Elegant, porcelain-skinned Genna Jing is sure her latest designs are worth a fortune. That's why she is willing to pay the fifty grand being demanded by the person who stole her design book. But when Lydia--backed by her partner Bill Smith--makes the drop, everything goes wrong. Soon a simple case of high-fashion extortion leads Lydia and Bill from Chinatown to Park Avenue, and from murder to more money: a million dollars in exchange for a missing man's life... <br></p><p>Lydia Chin, Rozan&#39;s sharp, funny and sexy detective who operates out of New York&#39;s Chinatown, is back in action in this lively story about the fashion industry -- from the glamorous designer studios to the sweatshops where illegal immigrants do the dirty work. Lydia knows the sweatshop scene well: her mother worked in one while she was growing up.

Throughout his tenure as a registry clerk with the Immigration Division of Ellis Island, Augustus F. Sherman systematically photographed more than 200 families, groups and individuals while they were being held by customs for special investigations. This volume collects and provides an essential revaluation of Sherman's striking portraits, which predate August Sander's cataloging efforts by several years. An historical document of unprecedented worth, <i>Augustus F. Sherman: Ellis Island Portraits</i> includes almost 100 portraits taken from 1905 through 1920. The subjects are frequently dressed in elaborate national costumes or folk dress, emphasizing the variety and richness of the cultural heritage that came together to form the United States. Romanian shepherds, German stowaways, Russian vegetarians, Greek priests and Ghanaian women in elaborately patterned dresses are treated with equal gravitas. The resulting body of work presents a unique and powerful picture of the stream of immigrants who came through Ellis Island. Though originally taken for his own personal study, Sherman's work appeared in the public eye as illustrations for publications with titles such as <i>Alien or American,</i> and hung on the walls of the customs offices as cautionary or exemplary models of the new Americans.</p><p>Augustus F. Sherman worked as a clerk in Ellis Island from 1892-1925. He was an untrained, yet highly gifted photographer who created hundreds of images documenting the new arrivals to America. At the time, his photographs were not taken in an official capacity but used by immigration officials to promote the work of Ellis Island. In 2008, the Minnesota History Center opened a new exhibit celebrating the human story of the more than twelve million immigrants who entered the United States. Today, Sherman&#x2019;s collections are housed in the Ellis Island Immigration Museum and the New York Public Library.<br><br>Peter Mesenh�ller has been a research associate and part-time museum educator with the Rautenstrauch-Joest Museum of Anthropology, Cologne (Germany) since 1990/2001. He is author of Mismeasurements: Other Bodies in 18th and 19th Century Ethnology and Anthropology (2002) and Mundus Novus: The Image of America as Mirrored in European Print Media from the 16th to the 20th century (1992). He has been a freelance curator since 1984. His shows include Picturing Paradise: Colonial Photography of Samoa 1875-1925, co-curated by Alison Devine Nordstr�m (1995-1996) and Augustus Frederick Sherman: Ellis Island Portraits 1905-1920 (2005-2008), co-curated with Diana Edkins.*Starred Review* The 97 full-page, sepia-tone portraits in this handsome volume are heartbreakingly beautiful. They were taken by amateur photographer Sherman, a clerk on Ellis Island during the period of mass immigration to America in the early twentieth century. Most of his subjects were immigrants detained at Ellis Island for further interrogation; the flat, impersonal captions that describe them tell a story of their own: "English-Jews," "Moroccan men and boy," "Greek woman," and "Tattooed German stowaway deported May 11." First you look at the pictures; then Peter Mesenholler's brilliant historical essay makes you go back to look at them again with a fresh perspective: this was a period of fierce American nativism, when the huddled masses of Latins, Slavs, Jews, etc., were regarded as dregs that threatened Anglo-Saxons with "racial suicide." Does the focus on elaborate national dress in the photos reinforce stereotype and the same exoticism as in Curtis' famous images of Native Americans? In fact, some of the photos are of distinct types, but their body language and expression also make you see close-up the wrenching personal anguish, loss, courage, and hope. Patrons researching family roots will want to examine these images, but the book will be of equal interest as a primary-source piece of American history and as a way to make connections to contemporary immigration issues. An exhibition of images from this book will open in June at the Ellis Island Museum and will then travel around the world. <i>Hazel Rochman</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

Proponents of &#39;Long-Term Lock-In&#39; theories such as Jared Diamond suggest that from time immemorial, some critical factor - geography, climate, or culture perhaps - made East and West unalterably different, and determined that the industrial revolution would happen in the West and push it further ahead of the East. But the East led the West between 500 and 1600, so this development can&#39;t have been inevitable; and so proponents of &#39;Short-Term Accident&#39; theories argue that Western rule was a temporary aberration that is now coming to an end, with Japan, China, and India resuming their rightful places on the world stage. However, as the West led for 9,000 of the previous 10,000 years, it wasn&#39;t just a temporary aberration. So, if we want to know why the West rules, we need a whole new theory. Ian Morris, boldly entering the turf of Jared Diamond and Niall Ferguson, provides the broader approach that is necessary, combining the textual historian&#39;s focus on context, the anthropological archaeologist&#39;s awareness of the deep past, and the social scientist&#39;s comparative methods to make sense of the past, present and future - in a way no one has ever done before.</p><p>Ian Morris is Willard Professor of Classics, Professor of History and Director of the Archaeology Centre at Stanford University. He has written and edited a number of books, most recently The Greeks: History, Culture, Society and The Ancient Economy: Evidence and Models, and has appeared on a number of television networks, including the History Network and PBS. This is his first trade book.<b>1<br>&nbsp;<br>BEFORE EAST AND WEST</b><br><b>&nbsp;</b><br><b>&nbsp;</b><br><b>WHAT IS THE WEST?</b><br>&#x201c;When a man is tired of London,&#x201d; said Samuel Johnson, &#x201c;he is tired of life; for there is in London all that life can aff ord.&#x201d; It was 1777, and every current of thought, every bright new invention, was energizing Dr. Johnson&#x2019;s hometown. London had cathedrals and palaces, parks and rivers, mansions and slums. Above all, it had things to buy&#x2014;things beyond the wildest imaginings of previous generations. Fine ladies and gentlemen could alight from carriages outside the new arcades of Oxford Street, there to seek out novelties like the umbrella, an invention of the 1760s that the British soon judged indispensable; or the handbag, or toothpaste, both of them products of the same decade. And it was not just the rich who indulged in this new culture of consumption. To the horror of conservatives, tradesmen were spending hours in coffee shops, the poor were calling tea a &#x201c;necessary,&#x201d; and farmers&#x2019; wives were buying pianos.<br>&nbsp;<br>The British were beginning to feel they were not like other people. In 1776 the Scottish sage Adam Smith had called them &#x201c;a nation of shopkeepers&#x201d; in his <i>Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations</i>, but he had meant it as a compliment; Britons&#x2019; regard for their own well-being, Smith insisted, was making everyone richer. Just think, he said, of the contrast between Britain and China. China had been &#x201c;long one of the richest, that is, one of the most fertile, best cultivated, most industrious, and most populous, countries of the world,&#x201d; but had already &#x201c;acquired that full complement of riches which the measure of its laws and institutions permits it to acquire.&#x201d; The Chinese, in short, were stuck. &#x201c;The competition of the labourers and the interest of the masters,&#x201d; Smith predicted, &#x201c;would soon reduce them to the lowest rate which is consistent with common humanity,&#x201d; with the consequence that &#x201c;the poverty of the lower ranks of people in China far surpasses that of the most beggarly nations in Europe . . . Any carrion, the carcase of a dead dog or cat, for example, though half putrid and stinking, is as welcome to them as the most wholesome food to the people of other countries.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>Johnson and Smith had a point. Although the industrial revolution had barely begun in the 1770s, average incomes were already higher and more evenly distributed in England than in China. Long-term lock-in theories of Western rule often start from this fact: the West&#x2019;s lead, they argue, was a cause rather than a consequence of the industrial revolution, and we need to look back further in time&#x2014;perhaps much further&#x2014;to explain it.<br>&nbsp;<br>Or do we? The historian Kenneth Pomeranz, whose book <i>The Great Divergence </i>I mentioned in the introduction, insists that Adam Smith and all the cheerleaders for the West who followed him were actually comparing the wrong things. China is as big and as varied, Pomeranz points out, as the whole continent of Europe. We should not be too surprised, then, that if we single out England, which was Europe&#x2019;s most developed region in Smith&#x2019;s day, and compare it with the average level of development in the whole of China, England scores higher. By the same token, if we turned things around and compared the Yangzi Delta (the most developed part of China in the 1770s) with the average level of development across the whole of Europe, the Yangzi Delta would score higher. Pomeranz argues that eighteenth-century England and the Yangzi Delta had more in common with each other (incipient industrialism, booming markets, complex divisions of labor) than England did with underdeveloped parts of Europe or the Yangzi Delta did with underdeveloped parts of China&#x2014;all of which leads him to conclude that long-term theorists get things back-to-front because their thinking has been sloppy. If England and the Yangzi Delta were so similar in the eighteenth century, Pomeranz observes, the explanation for Western rule must lie <i>after </i>this date, not before it.<br>&nbsp;<br>One implication is clear: if we want to know why the West rules, we first need to know what &#x201c;the West&#x201d; is. As soon as we ask that question, though, things get messy. Most of us have a gut feeling about what constitutes &#x201c;the West.&#x201d; Some people equate it with democracy and freedom; others with Christianity; others still with secular rationalism. In fact, the historian Norman Davies has found no fewer than twelve ways that academics define the West, united only by what he calls their &#x201c;elastic geography.&#x201d; Each definition gives the West a diff erent shape, creating exactly the kind of confusion that Pomeranz complains about. The West, says Davies, &#x201c;can be defined by its advocates in almost any way that they think fit,&#x201d; meaning that when we get right down to it, &#x201c;Western civilization is essentially an amalgam of intellectual constructs which were designed to further the interests of their authors.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>If Davies is right, asking why the West rules means nothing more than arbitrarily picking some value to define the West, claiming that a particular set of countries exemplifies this value, then comparing that set with an equally arbitrary set of &#x201c; non-Western&#x201d; countries to reach whatever self-serving conclusions we like. Anyone who disagrees with our conclusions can simply choose a diff erent value to exemplify Westernness, a diff erent set of countries exemplifying it, and a diff erent comparison set, coming&#x2014;naturally&#x2014;to a diff erent but equally self-serving conclusion.<br>&nbsp;<br>This would be pointless, so I want to take a diff erent approach. Instead of starting at the end of the process, making assumptions about what count as Western values and then looking back through time to find their roots, I will start at the beginning. I will move forward through time from the beginning until we reach a point at which we can see distinctive ways of life emerging in diff erent parts of the world. I will then call the westernmost of these distinctive regions &#x201c;the West&#x201d; and the easternmost &#x201c;the East,&#x201d; treating West and East for what they are&#x2014;geographical labels, not value judgments.<br>&nbsp;<br>Saying we must start at the beginning is one thing; finding it is another altogether. As we will see, there are several points in the distant past at which scholars have been tempted to define East and West in terms of biology, rejecting the argument I made in the introduction that folks (in large groups) are all much the same and instead seeing the people in one part of the world as genetically superior to everyone else. There are also points when it would be all too easy to conclude that one region has, since time immemorial, been culturally superior to all others. We must look into these ideas carefully, because if we make a misstep here at the start we will also get everything about the shape of the past, and therefore about the shape of the future, too, wrong.<br><b>&nbsp;</b><br><b>&nbsp;</b><br><b>IN THE BEGINNING</b><br>Every culture has had its own story about how things started, but in the last few years astrophysicists have given us some new, scientific versions. Most experts now think time and space began over 13 billion years ago, although they do not agree on just how that happened. The dominant &#x201c;inflationary&#x201d; theory holds that the universe initially expanded faster than the speed of light from an infinitely dense and infinitely small point, while a rival &#x201c;cyclical&#x201d; theory argues that it blew up when a previous universe collapsed. Both schools agree that our universe is still expanding, but while inflationists say it will continue to grow, the stars will go out, and eventually infinite darkness and coldness will descend, cyclists claim it will shrink back on itself, explode again, and start another new universe.<br>&nbsp;<br>It is hard to make much sense of these theories unless you have had years of advanced mathematical training, but fortunately our question does not require us to begin quite so early. There could be neither East nor West when there were no directions at all and when the laws of nature did not exist. Nor could East and West be useful concepts before our sun and planet took shape 4.5 billion years ago. Perhaps we can speak of East and West once the earth&#x2019;s crust formed, or at least once the continents reached something like their current positions, by which point we are already into the last few million years. Really, though, all these discussions are beside the point: East and West cannot mean anything for the question in this book until we add another ingredient to the mix&#x2014;humans.<br>&nbsp;<br>Paleoanthropologists, who study early humans, like controversy even more than historians do. Their field is young and fast moving, and new discoveries constantly turn established truths on their heads. If you get two paleoanthropologists into a room they are likely to come out with three theories of human evolution, and by the time the door shuts behind them, all will be out of date.<br>&nbsp;<br>The boundary between humans and prehumans is necessarily fuzzy. Some paleoanthropologists think that as soon as we see apes that could walk upright we should start speaking of humans. Judging from the fossilized remains of hip and toe bones, some East African apes began doing this 6 or 7 million years ago. Most experts, though, think this sets the bar too low, and standard biological classifications in fact define the genus <i>Homo </i>(&#x201c;mankind&#x201d; in Latin) by bundling together an increase in brain size from 400&#x2013;500 cubic centimeters to roughly 630 (our own brains are typically about twice as big) with the first evidence for upright apes smashing stones together to create crude tools. Both processes began among bipedal East African apes around 2.5 million years ago. Louis and Mary Leakey, the famous excavators of Olduvai Gorge in Tanzania (Figure 1.1), named these relatively big-brained, tool-using creatures <i>Homo habilis</i>, Latin for &#x201c;Handy Man.&#x201d; (Until recently, paleoanthropologists, like most people, thought nothing of applying the word &#x201c;man&#x201d; to individuals of both sexes; that has changed, but by convention scientists still use single-sex names like Handy Man.)<br>&nbsp;<br>East and West meant little when <i>Homo habilis </i>walked the earth&#x2014;first, because these creatures lived entirely within the forests of East Africa, and no regional variations had yet developed, and second, because the expression &#x201c;walked the earth&#x201d; is actually overly generous. Handy Men had toes and ankles like ours, and certainly did walk, but their long arms suggest that they also spent a lot of time in trees. These were fancy apes, but not much more. The marks their stone tools left on animal bones show that <i>Homo habilis </i>ate meat as well as plants, but it looks like they were still quite low on the food chain. Some paleoanthropologists defend a man-the-hunter theory, seeing <i>Homo habilis </i>as smart and brave enough to kill game armed with nothing more than sticks and broken stones, but others (rather more convincingly) see in <i>Homo habilis </i>man-the-scavenger, following the real killers (like lions) around, eating the bits they didn&#x2019;t want. Microscopic studies show that marks from Handy Man&#x2019;s tools did at least get onto animal bones before those from hyenas&#x2019; teeth.<br>&nbsp;<br>For 25,000 generations Handy Men scampered and swung through the trees in this little corner of the world, chipping stone tools, grooming each other, and mating. Then, somewhere around 1.8 million years ago, they disappeared. So far as we can tell this happened rather suddenly, although one of the problems in studying human evolution is the difficulty of dating finds precisely. Much of the time we depend on the fact that the layers of rock containing the fossil bones or tools may also contain unstable radioactive isotopes whose rate of decay is known, so that measuring the ratios between the isotopes gives dates for the finds. These dates, however, can have margins of error tens of thousands of years wide, so when we say the world of <i>Homo habilis </i>ended suddenly, &#x201c;suddenly&#x201d; may mean a few lifetimes or a few thousand lifetimes.<br>&nbsp;<br>When Charles Darwin was thinking about natural selection in the 1840s and 1850s he assumed that it worked through the slow accretion of tiny changes, but in the 1970s the biologist Stephen Jay Gould suggested instead that for long periods nothing much happens, then some event triggers a cascade of changes. Evolutionists nowadays divide over whether gradual change (evolution by creeps, as its critics call it) or Gould&#x2019;s &#x201c;punctuated equilibrium&#x201d; (evolution by jerks) is better as a general model, but the latter certainly seems to make most sense of <i>Homo habilis</i>&#x2019;s disappearance. About 1.8 million years ago East Africa&#x2019;s climate was getting drier and open savannas were replacing the forests where <i>Homo habilis </i>lived; and at just that point, new kinds of ape-men* took Handy Man&#x2019;s place.<br>&nbsp;<br>*The word &#x201c; ape-man,&#x201d; with its Tarzan-and-Jane connotations, was much favored in schoolbooks when I was young. Nowadays paleoanthropologists tend to think it condescending, but it seems to me to capture nicely the ambiguities of these prehuman hominins, and is certainly less of a mouthful.<br>&nbsp;<br>I want to hold off putting a name on these new ape-men, and for now will just point out that they had bigger brains than <i>Homo habilis</i>, typically about 800 cc. They lacked the long, chimplike arms of <i>Homo habilis</i>, probably meaning that they spent nearly all their time on the ground. They were also taller. A million-and-a-half-year-old skeleton from Nariokotome in Kenya, known as the Turkana Boy, belongs to a five-foot-tall child who would have reached six feet had he survived to adulthood. As well as being longer, his bones were less robust than those of <i>Homo habilis</i>, suggesting that he and his contemporaries relied more on their wits and tools than on brute strength.<br>&nbsp;<br>Most of us think that being smart is self-evidently good. Why, then, if <i>Homo habilis </i>had the potential to mutate in this direction, did they putter along for half a million years before &#x201c;suddenly&#x201d; morphing into taller, bigger-brained creatures? The most likely explanation lies in the fact that there is no such thing as a free lunch. A big brain is expensive to run. Our own brains typically make up 2 percent of our body weight but use up 20 percent of the energy we consume. Big brains create other problems too: it takes a big skull to hold a big brain&#x2014;so big, in fact, that modern women have trouble pushing babies with such big heads down their birth canals. Women deal with this by in eff ect giving birth prematurely. If our babies stayed in the womb until they were almost self-sufficient (like other mammals), their heads would be too big for them to get out.<br>&nbsp;<br>Yet risky childbirth, years of nurturing, and huge brains that burn up one fifth of our food intake are all fine with us&#x2014;finer, anyway, than using the same amounts of energy to grow claws, more muscles, or big teeth. Intelligence is much more of a plus than any of these alternatives. It is less obvious, though, why a genetic mutation producing bigger brains gave ape-men enough advantages to make the extra energy costs worthwhile a couple of million years ago. If being smarter had not been beneficial enough to pay the costs of...</p><h2>A Goofy Guide to Penguins: TOON Level 1 (TOON Books)</h2><p>How can you tell penguins apart?

Bachelor himself, a hair's breadth away from sleeping in his car, is clawing his way back to stability; Hannah Weiss, the double agent whose recruitment was his only success, is starting to enjoy the secrets and lies her role demands; and Lech Wicinski, an Intelligence Service analyst, finds that a simple favour for an old acquaintance might derail his career. Meanwhile, Lady Di Taverner is trying to keep the Service on an even keel, and if that means throwing the odd crew member overboard, well: collateral damage is her speciality.Publisher: Hodder &amp; Stoughton General Division ISBN: 9781473678309</p><p></p><h2>The Philadelphia Campaign, 1777-1778 (Modern War Studies (Hardcover))</h2><p>American fortunes were at a low point in the winter of 1777-78. The British had beaten the Continental Army at Brandywine and Germantown, seized the colonial capital of Philadelphia, and driven Washington's soldiers into barren Valley Forge. But, as Stephen Taaffe reveals, the Philadelphia Campaign marked a turning point in the American Revolution despite these setbacks.<br><br>Occurring in the middle of the war in the heart of the colonies, this key but overlooked campaign dwarfed all others in the war in terms of numbers of combatants involved, battles fought, and casualties sustained. For the first time, British and American armies engaged out in the open on relatively equal terms. Although the British won all the major battles, they were unable to crush the rebellion.<br><br>Taaffe presents a new narrative history of this campaign that took place not only in the hills and woods surrounding Philadelphia, but also in east central New Jersey and along the Delaware River. He uses the campaign to analyze British and American strategies, evaluate Washington's leadership, and assess the role of subordinate officers such as Nathanael Greene and Anthony Wayne. He also offers new insights into eighteenth-century warfare and shows how Washington transcended traditional military thinking to fashion a strategy that accommodated American social, political, and economic realities.<br><br>During this campaign Washington came into his own as a commander of colonial forces and an astute military strategist, and Taaffe demonstrates that Washington used the fighting around Philadelphia as a proving ground for strategies that he applied later in the war. Taaffe also scrutinizes Washington's relationship with the militia, whose failure to carry out its missions contributed to the general's problems.<br><br>Still, by enduring their losses and continuing to fight, the Americans exacted a heavy toll on Britain's resources, helped to convince France to enter the war, and put the redcoats on the defensive. As Taaffe shows, far from being inconclusive, the Philadelphia Campaign contributed more to American victory than the colonists recognized at the time.</p><p>"An impressively researched, well organized, concise, and judicious study of an important campaign of the Revolutionary War."--Charles Royster, author of <i>A Revolutionary People at War</i> <p>"A fine work of historical synthesis that should appeal to the general reader. Taaffe provides a clear, well-informed, and balanced treatment of both sides in the conflict."--John Shy, author of <i>A People Numerous and Armed</i> </p><p>"Taaffe's engaging new book is a valuable and welcome addition to studies about Revolutionary America, and a pleasure to read."--James Kirby Martin, author of <i>Benedict Arnold, Revolutionary Hero: An American Warrior Reconsidered</i></p>Stephen R.

An assistant clerk at Agra Central Jail, he suddenly found himself a personal attendant to the Empress of India herself. Within a year, he was established as a powerful figure at court, becoming the queen's teacher, or Munshi, and instructing her in Urdu and Indian affairs. Devastated by the death of John Brown, her Scottish ghillie, the queen had at last found his replacement. But her intense and controversial relationship with the Munshi led to a near-revolt in the royal household. "Victoria &amp; Abdul" examines how a young Indian Muslim came to play a central role at the heart of the empire, and his influence over the queen at a time when independence movements in the sub-continent were growing in force. Yet, at its heart, it is a tender love story between an ordinary Indian and his elderly queen, a relationship that survived the best attempts to destroy it.</p><p>Shrabani Basu was born in Calcutta and grew up in Dhaka, Kathmandu and Delhi.

He lives in California. <br> <br> Read on for Williams and Christopher Paolini's discussion about why they write fantasy, their upcoming projects, and more. <br> <br> <strong>Tad:</strong> Hi, Christopher. Nice to talk to you, albeit virtually. It was great hanging out with you and your family this summer. Pretty much all of us fell in love with your part of the world, too. <br> <br> Be warned: this isn't my best time of the day, so if I start calling you "Herman" and asking what it was about whaling that interested you, please forgive. <br> <br> The first thing I'd like to ask you as a starter question is: why fantasy? I mean, there's the obvious answer (which is also true for me) that it was something I loved to read growing up, but I guess I'm curious what is it that still resonates for you. Why do these kind of stories, these kinds of characters, these kinds of worlds, still speak to you? <br> <br> In a similar vein, do you have another kind of fiction, another genre, that you'd really like to try? If so, why? Any genres you think you'll never write but wish you could? <br> <br> <strong>Christopher:</strong> Hi Tad. Great talking to you as well. We all had a wonderful time when you guys visited. Definitely one Of the highlights of the year. <br> <br> I'm still waking up as well -- takes a few cups of tea and a few strips of bacon before the little gray cells start firing properly -- so if I sound a bit muddled, that's why. Still, we can make a stab at coherency, eh? <br> <br> Hmm. Why do I write fantasy? As you said, it's because I enjoy reading it, but I enjoy reading it because . . . well, for a number of reasons, I suppose. First of all, fantasy allows for all sorts of dangerous situations, and those can provide a lot of excitement in a story. And excitement is always fun. Also, epic fantasy usually deals with themes and situations that everyone can relate to, such as the challenge of growing up, or how one is supposed to deal with moral quandaries. Fantasy is the oldest form of literature; the very first stories that humans told while crouched around campfires were stories about gods and monsters and tragic mistakes and heroic feats. Even now, those topics still resonate with us on a primal level, which is one reason I think fantasy will remain popular with readers as long as humans are still human. And I love the sense of awe and wonder one can often find in fantastical literature. . . . Fantasy can allow you to see and hear and experience things that have never existed and never *could* exist. To me, that is the closest we come to real magic in this world. <br> <br> That said, there are a number of other genres I'd like to try my hand at: mystery, thriller, horror, science-fiction, romance, etc. I love stories of all kinds -- although mythic ones certainly hold the greatest appeal to me -- and I'm very much looking forward to experimenting once I finish the Inheritance cycle. Any genres I think I'll never write but wish I could? . . . Probably long-form epic poetry or a witty comedy of manners. Poetry is fun, but my grasp on it is rather shaky, and a comedy of manners (while I enjoy them) is so different from my usual life, I'm not sure I could pull it off properly. <br> <br> And now a question for you: You have just finished your third (large) series. What is it about big epic stories that so fascinates you? Why not write small, intimate books about a fishmonger whose greatest love is his toothpick sculpture of the Brooklyn Bridge? <br> <br> <b> Read the full conversation </b>Christopher Paolini&#x2019;s abiding love of fantasy and science fiction inspired him to begin writing his debut novel, <i>Eragon, </i>when he graduated from high school at 15.

Setting out from Carthaginian-dominated Spain with a small army of select troops, he fought his way over the Pyrenees and crossed the Alps with elephants and a full baggage train. Descending into Italy, he destroyed the main Roman army at Lake Trasimeno and came close to conquering Rome itself. At Cannae, Hannibal&#39;s brilliant cavalry tactics enabled him to cut to pieces a reassembled Roman army, and his subsequent defeats over a fifteen-year stay in Italy were due more to lack of sufficient support from home than to any failings of generalship.T. A. Dodge&#39;s classic history, first published in 1891, is equally perceptive of Hannibal&#39;s military prowess and his visionary character. Dodge followed Hannibal&#39;s route from Carthage to Italy, paying particular attention to the famous crossing of the Alps, exploring every pass in order to determine Hannibal&#39;s route. In this book, he wrote an entire history of the art of war among these two mighty armies and included hundreds of invaluable illustrations. Hannibal remains unequaled as the most comprehensive and readable study of history&#39;s greatest general.</p><p>THEODORE AYRAULT DODGE (1842-1909) was considered by his contemporaries, as well as by many later historians, to be the greatest American military historian of the nineteenth century and an unparalleled biographer of some of history&#39;s greatest generals and commanders. He fought in the Union Army in some of the Civil War&#39;s fiercest and costliest engagements, including the Seven Days Battle, Second Bull Run, and Chancellorsville, until he lost his right leg at Gettysburg. These experiences provided him with insights into the realities of warfare that are sometimes lacking in the work of purely academic or &#39;&#39;armchair&#39;&#39; military historians.''This book has never been bettered.'' --Michael Grant, author of <i>History of Rome</i></p><h2>I Fired God: My Life Inside---and Escape from---the Secret World of the Independent Fundamental Baptist Cult</h2><p><p><i><b>A compelling memoir and account of the Independent Fundamental Baptist church and its shocking history of religious abuse.</b></i></p><p>Jocelyn Zichterman was born, raised, married into, and finally, with her family, fled the Independent Fundamental Baptist church. Founded by the fiery preacher Bob Jones, with several hundred thousand members, IFB congregants are told they must not associate with members of other Baptist denominations and evangelicals, with an emphasis on secrecy, insular marriages within the church, a subservience for women, and unusual child raising practices. </p><p>In <i>I Fired God,</i> Jocelyn Zichterman systematically details the IFB's disturbing history, exposing a cult-like atmosphere of corruption, greed, and abuse. Having been initiated into its innermost circles, Zichterman knows that the gentle demeanor America sees in the form of the Duggar clan on <i>19 Kids and Counting</i> disguises the truth about the darker side of the church. <br>With written documentation and sources so thorough that law enforcement has used her work as a foundation for criminal prosecutions, Zichterman exposes the IFB with revelations including: </p><p>- The disturbing world of abuse within the IFB and doctors and teachers who cater exclusively to church members and fail to report physical and sexual abuse</p><p>- The IFB-controlled Bob Jones University, which issues degrees of questionable value while making vast sums of money for its founders</p><p>- The way the IFB influences politics on the local, state, and national level, and protects its abusive culture under the constitutional guarantee of freedom of religion</p></p><p><p>JOCELYN ZICHTERMAN is an abuse advocate and whistleblower fighting against the IFB Church.

Those of you who don&#x2019;t want to do right usually have a run-in with me. You know why? Because I&#x2019;m ordained by God to stand in this position. <br> <i>&#x2014;Bart Janz, sermon, &#x201c;God and Government II,&#x201d; Holly Ridge Baptist Church, 2006</i> <br>Escaping the Cult: August 1, 2006 <br>I looked down at my hand and realized I was trembling. Terror. That&#x2019;s the only word to describe what I felt. I forced myself to add another item to my long &#x201c;to do&#x201d; list, but the pen shook so much that my writing was nearly illegible. Taking several deep breaths and struggling to calm myself, I glanced out the window into a black, moonless night. <br>It was two in the morning and the house was silent. My husband, Joseph, and all eight of my children had gone to bed hours ago, but I couldn&#x2019;t sleep. I hadn&#x2019;t been able to for more than a week now, knowing that hour by hour the moment was drawing closer when we would leave everything we knew behind and head into a future as inscrutable as the blackness outside the window. <br>From my seat at the mahogany table in our dining room, I took in my surroundings. There was the china cabinet that held our most cherished wedding gifts. And the grandfather clock we had inherited from my husband, Joseph&#x2019;s, late mother. This had always been my favorite room, and I was sitting in it for the last time. It was where I had read my Bible and prayed every morning over my breakfast tea for the past six years. Now, I realized, I was no longer sure I believed any of the words in the Holy Bible. I wondered if there was a God at all. But I forced those thoughts to the back of my mind. The only thing that mattered was whether we would all survive the journey ahead. <br>We had been planning it for months&#x2014;carefully and quietly organizing our departure from the Independent Fundamental Baptist (IFB) church, like captives secretly plotting an escape from their guards&#x2014;ever since I had spoken up about the brutal abuse I had endured as a child at the hands of my father, Bart Janz, an influential IFB pastor in Brighton, Colorado. Sadistic mind games and vicious beatings were a part of everyday life for my four siblings and me from toddlerhood throughout our teen years&#x2014;beatings during which I was sometimes forced to lie naked facedown on my bed for hours while my father flogged me until I was bloody and could barely walk, sermonizing between each blow. Determined to keep his &#x201c;house in order,&#x201d; he wielded power with a Bible in one hand and a thick wooden dowel in the other. A chilling image of him rose up in my mind, eyes black and purple veins pulsating in his neck as they always did when he was in a rage. <br>I could almost feel raw, angry welts rising afresh on the backs of my legs. Fear surged through me, but I shook it off. There was no time to panic, no time to curl up in the corner and weep. I was determined to save my own children from my fate&#x2014;from growing up in a community and a faith that not only tolerated but advocated torturing children to crush their will. I had to get them as far away as possible. And I had only a few hours to do it. <br>Breaking My Silence: January 2005 <br>An overwhelming fear for my children had convinced me to end my long silence about my own past a year earlier. When I finally confided in Joseph, in early 2005, the stories tumbling out in an anguished torrent, he was horrified. He had joined the church at the age of thirteen without his parents&#x2019; involvement, and, not having grown up in an IFB family, he had no firsthand knowledge of the shattering physical and psychological damage fathers like mine did to their children under the guise of godly discipline. <br>Learning about my childhood sent Joseph into an intense moral struggle. He loved me and he knew I was telling the truth. But standing by me now would require abandoning his entire way of life. As a man in a fiercely male-dominated subculture, he had always been treated well. He was respected, even revered in the IFB. He had been a frequent IFB conference speaker as well as a professor at one of the most prominent IFB colleges for over a decade. At the age of only thirty-three, he had even received an honorary doctorate from Bob Jones University, the IFB&#x2019;s worldwide headquarters, located in Greenville, South Carolina. So up to this point, the strongest reprimands he had ever gotten from the church leaders had come for failing to keep me sufficiently meek and submissive. He had spent years listening to IFB preachers warn that women were deceivers, Jezebels, put on earth to lead men astray ever since that fateful day when Eve handed Adam the forbidden fruit. He had also been indoctrinated in the IFB paranoia that the world beyond our insular community was wicked and that venturing into it was a one-way ticket to damnation. When Joseph ultimately chose to support my decision to leave the IFB, it was a turning point in our marriage as well as our lives. He knew he was in for the fight of his life. <br>My husband called my father at his home in Colorado and told him what he had done to me was wrong. But if he was hoping for a mea culpa he didn&#x2019;t know Bart Janz. The man who had made my childhood a living hell now turned his full fury on Joseph and vowed to make our adult lives equally hellish. <br>He swore he would destroy Joseph&#x2019;s career, ruin us financially, and make sure we never left the IFB. He called the IFB leaders at Northland Baptist Bible College, where Joseph was a professor, to tell them I was making wild allegations and trying to lure my husband away from &#x201c;the only true church.&#x201d; He painted us in the blackest light possible. The IFB leaders were powerful men and close friends of my father&#x2019;s, and, as far as I can tell, they backed every move he made against us, informing Joseph a short time later that they were terminating his teaching position at the end of that semester. This only enflamed my father&#x2019;s rage toward us and reinforced his sense of righteous indignation. We lived in a small, isolated town in the middle of the Wisconsin woods, five miles from the nearest two-lane highway, where nearly everyone belonged to the IFB. We had nowhere we could turn in our own community for help. <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m coming to deal with you publicly in front of the entire community whether you like it or not!&#x201d; my father screamed over the phone. Joseph tried repeatedly to reason with him. When that failed, he threatened him with a restraining order, but it only threw fuel on the fire. <br>&#x201c;This is going to trail you, buddy, for the rest of your life!&#x201d; my father bellowed. &#x201c;This is war!&#x201d; <br>My Paralyzing Fear <br>All my life my father had warned me that he would kill me if I ever talked about the abuse I had suffered at his hands. My formative years were full of death threats from him, and somewhere in the back of my mind I had always expected him to carry through. It was just a question of when. I knew the man was capable of bloodshed. I had seen him torture animals to death, even beloved family pets, many times. <br>Now a new terror seized me: Would he try to do the same to my children? The thought was unbearable. One night a few months earlier I had been gripped with such a paralyzing fear that I had called 911. <br>&#x201c;He&#x2019;s coming! I don&#x2019;t know what he&#x2019;ll do!&#x201d; I screamed into the phone. <br>The 911 operator tried to make sense of my hysteria. &#x201c;Who&#x2019;s coming, ma&#x2019;am? Where is he coming to?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;My father! I confronted him about abusing me and now he says he&#x2019;s coming to my home! And I have eight children!&#x201d; Months of stress had taken a heavy toll on my body and my mind, and confessing my fears to a stranger pushed me over the edge. I collapsed into uncontrollable, shuddering sobs while the operator attempted to calm me down. <br>My life had become like a scene from a horror movie, where you&#x2019;re holding your breath and tensing every muscle, waiting for the monster to spring out. But for me the scene never ended. How many nights had I crept from my bed and peered warily out our windows? It was hard to see the yard in the dead of night and even harder to see the woods behind it, but I was convinced that one night soon my father would slip into them unnoticed to watch us from the shadows. The wind would rustle a branch, and I would freeze, sure I saw him lurking in the trees, ready to strike. <br>Sometimes I felt like I couldn&#x2019;t survive one more day. But my kids&nbsp;&#x2026; what would happen to them if I gave up? They were the reason I kept going, steeling myself, expecting at every moment to hear my father pounding on the front door and shouting my name, to see him burst in wielding his wooden dowel over us as my children cowered in fear behind me. <br>BAM! <br>The silence of the night was broken by the sudden slam of a door. My heart took off like a thoroughbred out of the starting gate. My body stiffened, bracing for the figure from my nightmares to come striding into my dining room. A moment later, relief swept through me as I heard light footsteps run down the hallway, away from the bathroom. One of the kids was headed back to bed, blissfully unaware of the danger surrounding all of us. <br>I closed my eyes and tried to think through the hours ahead. Had I overlooked anything? Forgotten any documents or essentials for the children? Was that a footstep I heard outside? I had been operating on no more than five fitful, nightmare-filled hours of sleep for months. No doubt chronic sleep deprivation was fueling my delusions and paranoia. But even in my addled state, I was clear on one point: The IFB was a cult, and getting our children away from it was essential. We had to break free. <br>Was the devil behind us or up ahead? I didn&#x2019;t know. <br> <br>&nbsp; <br>Copyright � 2013 by Jocelyn R.

Thirty years ago, James introduced a new approach to evaluating players and strategies, and now his theories have become indispensable tools for agents, statistics analysts, maverick general managers, and anyone who is serious about understanding the game.<br><br>James began writing about baseball while working at a factory in his native Kansas. In lively, often acerbic prose, he used statistics to challenge entrenched beliefs and uncover surprising truths about the game. His annual <i>Baseball Abstract</i> captured the attention of fans and front offices and went on to become a bestselling staple of the baseball book category. In 2002, the Boston Red Sox hired James as an advisor. Two years later they achieved their long-awaited World Series triumph.<br><br><i>The Mind of Bill James</i> tells the story of how a gifted outsider inspired a new understanding of baseball. It delves deeply into James&#x2019;s essential wisdom&#x2013;including his surprising beliefs about pitch counts and the importance of batting-order, thoughts on professionalism and psychology, and why teams tend to develop the characteristics that are least favored by their home parks. It also brings together his best writing, much of it long out of print, as well as insights from new interviews. Written with James&#x2019; full cooperation, it is at once an eye-opening portrait of baseball&#x2019;s virtuoso analyst and a treasury of his idiosyncratic genius.</p></p><p><p>SCOTT GRAY is the author of a series of Street &amp; Smith&#x2019;s sports annuals. He lives in Charlottesville, Virginia.</p>Bill went into the army at the start of December 1971. &#x201c;I believe I was the last person drafted from the state of Kansas,&#x201d; he says. &#x201c;They had us raise our hands and swore us in. Then the officer in charge informed us that, because enlistments were ahead of schedule, they had temporarily stopped the draft, right after my group. But they never did have to resume, and then the draft was ended.&#x201d; <br><br>Bill had a harder time than most getting through basic training. &#x201c;You have to understand,&#x201d; he says, &#x201c;as a soldier, I failed every test you can fail.&nbsp;I simply had no ability to do any of the things the army wants you to do. I couldn&#x2019;t do push-ups. I couldn&#x2019;t shoot a rifle worth a crap. I couldn&#x2019;t march fast or climb obstacle courses, I couldn&#x2019;t assemble and re-assemble a rifle quickly, I couldn&#x2019;t keep my shoes shined or my shirt-tail tucked in.&nbsp;I was constantly singled out, in training, as the guy who didn&#x2019;t get it. I very seriously did not think that, if I wound up in Vietnam, I was coming back.&#x201d;<br><br>Bill doesn&#x2019;t tell stories, but he has one he likes to tell about being shipped out. He says, &#x201c;When I was completing the final stage of draftee training, they marched us to a center to pick up our unit assignment. The address on my assignment was an overseas shipping center in San Francisco, which meant Vietnam. Then&#x2013;I swear this is true&#x2013;we marched back to the training company and, for the first time in weeks, were allowed to turn on the television. Richard Nixon was on, and he was announcing new policies aimed at ending the war protests. One of the new policies was that draftees would no longer be sent to Vietnam. But, Nixon specified, draftees who already had their orders for Vietnam would have to go, but no new draftees would be sent there. <br><br>&#x201c;I couldn&#x2019;t believe it! They got me <i>again</i>. I already had my orders--had had them for ten or fifteen minutes before the policy was announced. At this point I was absolutely convinced that I was going to be the last soldier killed in Vietnam. I was going to take a bullet, and just as I went down Henry Kissinger was going to coming running up waving his arms, saying, &#x2018;It&#x2019;s over, it&#x2019;s over.&nbsp;Stop shooting.&#x2019; But fortunately the army was too disorganized at that time to keep track of who had received their orders when, so when I got to San Francisco they weren&#x2019;t sending any draftees to Vietnam. They changed my orders to send me to Korea.&#x201d;<br><br>He says the main thing he took from his time in the army was the opportunity to work with a first sergeant named Clarence Bray. &#x201c;He was a fine man, a Kentuckian with a high school education,&#x201d; Bill says. &#x201c;He knew how to organize and get things done. This probably sounds stupid, because, as anybody knows, I am not at all organized, but you should have seen me <i>before</i> I worked with Sergeant Bray. I&#x2019;m ten times better organized now than I was before. I learned at least as much from him as I did from any professor.&#x201d;<br>***********<br><br>Bill says, &#x201c;In our society, we use &#x2018;psychology&#x2019; as an explanation for anything we don&#x2019;t understand. This is precisely the way people identified witchcraft for hundreds of years. The widow Mueller walked by about 3:00 as I was milking my cow, the milk turned out to be sour, there&#x2019;s no reason why that milk would be sour . . . it must be witchcraft. <br><br>&#x201c;My point is, in order to show that something is a psychological effect, you need to show that it <i>is</i> a psychological effect--not merely that it isn&#x2019;t something else.&nbsp;Which people still don&#x2019;t get. They look at things as logically as they can, and, not seeing any other difference between A and B conclude that the difference between them is psychology.<br><br>&#x201c;We don&#x2019;t understand why the Red Sox played better without Nomar than with him, so we credit it to clubhouse psychology. We don&#x2019;t understand why Joe Torre is successful, so we claim that he is a master psychologist. This is illogical, and it isn&#x2019;t really any different than attributing it to witchcraft. People used &#x2018;witchcraft&#x2019; to explain why babies died in their cribs and why cats act weird. Using &#x2018;psychology&#x2019; in the same way isn&#x2019;t any better, and it isn&#x2019;t a service to <i>real</i> psychology. It is actually <i>defending</i> real psychology to resist the bastardization of the term.<br>***********<br><br>The data needed to test much of baseball&#x2019;s traditional knowledge always existed, but opinion and lore lorded over research. It&#x2019;s so much easier to form an opinion than to study a question, like the difference between making babies and raising children. Rather than start with an opinion and build a case, Bill began with the question and searched for evidence to help answer it. &#x201c;Perhaps the central tenet of my career,&#x201d; he says, &#x201c;is that hard information is much more powerful than soft information. Whenever you add hard, solid facts to a discussion, it changes that discussion in far-reaching ways, and sometimes in unfortunate ways.&#x201d; <br>***********<br><br>Susie says, &#x201c;Publishing the books at home he could print what he wrote, just as he wrote it. To have someone he didn&#x2019;t know come in and start giving advice was difficult for him. He knows what he wants to do, and if there&#x2019;s any suggestion to the contrary, he tends to take offense. Since I used to read everything and did a lot of his typing, I learned early on that it was a risky business to point out even spelling errors.&nbsp;I just corrected them and went on.&nbsp;If I thought a sentence was poorly worded or needed punctuation,&nbsp;I learned to keep my opinion to myself.&#x201d; Once, one of her professors called to say he enjoyed the book, but couldn&#x2019;t resist passing along one thing he wished were different. &#x201c;He thought it was a little lazy to use cuss words,&#x201d; Susie says. &#x201c;I told Bill about his advice, but of course it didn&#x2019;t do a damn bit of good.&#x201d;<br>***********<br><br>By the mid-eighties, the <i>Abstract</i> and its author had become a cultural marker. <i>Newsweek</i> once called the <i>Janus Report</i> &#x201c;the sexual equivalent of the <i>Bill James Baseball Abstract</i>.&#x201d; There were references to &#x201c;the Bill James of education policy,&#x201d; of suicide, and movies, elections, comedy, weather. . . . A book review in the <i>Chicago</i> <i>Tribune</i> praised an author for being to politics what Bill James is to baseball: &#x201c;a mix of historian, social observer, and numbers cruncher who illuminates his subject with perspective and a touch of irreverence.&#x201d;<br>***********<br><br>The <i>Boston Globe</i>&#x2019;s Bob Ryan posited in 1984 that Bill could be as important to baseball as Alexander Cartwright, &#x201c;who codified the game,&#x201d; and Babe Ruth. Recently it&#x2019;s been much noted that Bill James didn&#x2019;t invent statistical analysis in baseball. That&#x2019;s true, of course, just as it&#x2019;s true that baseball existed before Cartwright codified it and that Ruth wasn&#x2019;t the first player to hit the longball chicks dig.<br><br>But all three epitomize what Japanese artisan Kaneshige Michiaki meant when he said, &#x201c;Tradition is always changing. Tradition consists of creating something new with what one has inherited.&#x201d; Mr. Michiaki explained that people sometimes confuse <i>tradition</i> with <i>transmission</i>. Copying what came before is transmission. Producing something new while incorporating what came before&#x2013;<i>that&#x2019;s</i> tradition.<br>***********<br><br>&#x201c;What about No-mah?&#x201d; I asked Bill. &#x201c;A lot of people thought you screwed up.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I thought a lot of people had an unrealistic view,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;The reality is that we didn&#x2019;t own Nomar&#x2019;s future. Nomar owned Nomar&#x2019;s future. Some people wrote about it as if we&#x2019;d traded six years of Nomar Garciappara. We didn&#x2019;t own that, nor did we have any great chance of obtaining it.&#x201d;<br><br>What about for the rest of the season?<br><br>&#x201c;We&#x2019;d lost confidence that he was going to help us win. His effort was fantastic. Sometimes he tries <i>too</i> hard. But it wasn&#x2019;t working. We had lost confidence that it was going to work.&#x201d;<br><br>Was it a panic move?<br><br>&#x201c;Well, if you&#x2019;re trying to start a fire, and you have a box of matches, and you start striking matches and throwing them in there, and the fire&#x2019;s not lighting, you start to feel kind of desperate. We weren&#x2019;t desperate, but we were getting down to our last match. We felt that the team should ignite, but it hadn&#x2019;t. Fortunately, finally it did.&#x201d;<br><br><b>A.L. Division Series 2004: Sox 3, Angels 0<br></b>The Sox blazed through August and September to win the Wild Card, then swept the division series against the Angels. David Ortiz won the final game in extra innings with a walk-off homer. Bill and Susie were watching the game at home. Bill says that what he&#x2019;ll always remember is the move manager Terry Francona <i>didn&#x2019;t</i> make. In the ninth inning, score tied, Ortiz drew a walk. Bill says, &#x201c;Tim McCarver and Joe Buck, broadcasting the game, felt certain that Terry should pinch run for Ortiz, try to move the runner into scoring position, and play for one run. Susie was screaming at the television, &#x2018;No! No! Don&#x2019;t pinch run for him! We need his bat!&#x2019; And Terry, thank God, saw it the way Susie did. The gain in the <i>chance</i> of scoring that run wasn&#x2019;t worth taking David&#x2019;s bat out of the lineup.&#x201d;<br><br>In the eleventh inning Ortiz stepped up and blasted the Sox into the ALCS.<br><br><b>A.L.

Redfield: Just Values and Fine Seeing</h2><p><p>Trained at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts in Philadelphia and arguably the stylistic leader of the Pennsylvania Impressionist school of painting, Edward W. Redfield (1869-1965) was fascinated by the forces that colored an individual's reaction to nature. His paintings reflected an engagement with the American experience, in an unsentimental impressionist style. A painter of great immediacy, Redfield understood that art was an expressive activity rooted in sensibility and feeling, and advised other artists, "See it, seize it, remember it&#x2014;then get out and paint it."</p><p>The phenomenal popularity of Redfield from 1900 to 1920 cannot be fully understood without considering how his life and work were viewed as the embodiment of a national spirit of the progress of America. Redfield's paintings embodied the rawness and energy of America during a period of transformation from a predominantly agrarian to an industrialized capitalist nation. Not only did these bold, vibrant pictures provide welcome images of the natural world, they exuded a spirit of personal authenticity, and stability for an audience in search of these qualities.</p><p>With extraordinary access to the rich collection of the Redfield family archives, Constance Kimmerle is able to broaden the understanding of the artist and his work.

From the postwar covers of <i>Vogue</i> to the triumph of the digital image, the fashion photographer sold not only clothes but ideals of beauty and visions of perfect lives. Even when they succumbed to temptation and excess&#x2014;and did they ever&#x2014;the very few photographers who rose to the top were artists, above all.<br> <br> <i>Focus</i> probes the lives, hang-ups, and artistic triumphs of more than a dozen of fashion photography&#x2019;s greatest visionaries: Richard Avedon, Irving Penn, Melvin Sokolsky, Bert Stern, David Bailey, Bill King, Deborah Turbeville, Helmut Newton, Gilles Bensimon, Bruce Weber, Steven Meisel, Corinne Day, Bob and Terry Richardson, and more. From Avedon&#x2019;s haute couture fantasies and telling portraits to Weber&#x2019;s sensual, intimate, and heroic slices of life, and from Bob Richardson&#x2019;s provocations to his son Terry&#x2019;s transgressions, <i>Focus</i> takes readers behind the scenes to reveal the revolutionary creative processes and fraught private passions of these visionary magicians.<br> <br> Tracing the highs and lows of fashion photography from the late 1940s to today, Gross vividly chronicles the fierce rivalries between photographers, fashion editors, and publishers like Cond� Nast and Hearst, weaving together candid interviews, never-before-told insider anecdotes and insights born of his three decades of front-row and backstage reporting on modern fashion.

Dorinda Dixon Ryan, known as D.D., who&#x2019;d worked under Vreeland at Harper&#x2019;s Bazaar, was seated next to Carolyne Roehm, one among many fashion designers in attendance. Mica Ertegun and Chessy Rayner, the society decorators, sat with Reinaldo Herrera, holder of the Spanish title Marqu�s of Torre Casa, whose family estate in Venezuela, built in 1590, is said to be the oldest continuously inhabited home in the Western Hemisphere.<br> <br>One of Vreeland&#x2019;s sons delivered a eulogy, as did socialite C. Z. Guest; Pierre Berg�, the business partner of Yves Saint Laurent; Oscar de la Renta, the society dressmaker; Philippe de Montebello, then the museum&#x2019;s director and Vreeland&#x2019;s final boss when she ran its Costume Institute; and George Plimpton, who cowrote her memoir, D.V. But the afternoon&#x2019;s most telling fashion moment came in between Montebello and Plimpton, when photographer Richard Avedon, who&#x2019;d worked with Vreeland from the start of his career, took the stage.<br> <br>Avedon was a giant in fashion and society, an insider and an iconoclast, a trenchant critic of the very worlds that had made him a star, arguably the most celebrated photographer of the twentieth century. Never one to mince words or spare the feelings of others (&#x201c;Oh, Dick, Dick, Dick is such a dick,&#x201d; a junior fashion editor once said), he used his eulogy as a gun aimed at Vreeland&#x2019;s latest successor at Vogue, Anna Wintour.<br> <br>Though he never once mentioned her name, he sought to wound Wintour, who&#x2019;d arrived at the memorial with her bosses, the heads of Cond� Nast Publications, S. I. &#x201c;Si&#x201d; Newhouse Jr., the company&#x2019;s chairman, and Alexander Liberman, its editorial director. Just a year earlier, they&#x2019;d let Wintour replace Avedon as the photographer of Vogue&#x2019;s covers. Only a few in the audience knew that Avedon had actually shot a cover for the November 1988 issue, Wintour&#x2019;s first as editor in chief of Vogue, and that no one had bothered to alert him that Wintour had replaced it with a picture by the much-younger Peter Lindbergh. Avedon only found out when the printed issue arrived at his studio.<br> <br>He never shot for Vogue again.<br> <br>A year later, Avedon served up his revenge dressed in a tribute to the woman he&#x2019;d sometimes refer to as his &#x201c;crazy aunt&#x201d; Diana. Avedon recalled their first meeting in 1945 when he was twenty-two and fresh out of the merchant marine. Carmel Snow was about to make true his short lifetime&#x2019;s dream of taking photographs for Harper&#x2019;s Bazaar, the magazine she edited that he&#x2019;d first encountered as the son of a Fifth Avenue fashion retailer. Newspaper and magazine stories about the Vreeland memorial would linger on in Avedon&#x2019;s recollections of their first meeting, how he watched her stick a pin into both a dress and the model wearing it, &#x201c;who let out a little scream,&#x201d; he remembered. Vreeland turned to him for the very first time and said, &#x201c;Aberdeen, Aberdeen, doesn&#x2019;t it make you want to cry?&#x201d;<br> <br>It did, he went on, but not because he loved the dress or appreciated the mangling of his name. He went back to Carmel Snow and said, &#x201c;I can&#x2019;t work with that woman.&#x201d; Snow replied that he would, &#x201c;and I did,&#x201d; Avedon continued, &#x201c;to my enormous benefit, for almost forty years.&#x201d;<br> <br>But that charming opening anecdote was nothing compared to what followed. Avedon extolled Vreeland&#x2019;s virtues, &#x201c;the amazing gallop of her imagination,&#x201d; her preternatural understanding of what women would want to wear, her &#x201c;sense of humor so large, so generous, she was ever ready to make a joke of herself,&#x201d; and the diligence that made her &#x201c;the hardest-working person I&#x2019;ve ever known. . . .<br> <br>&#x201c;I am here as a witness,&#x201d; Avedon concluded. &#x201c;Diana lived for imagination ruled by discipline, and created a totally new profession. Vreeland invented the fashion editor. Before her, it was society ladies who put hats on other society ladies. Now, it&#x2019;s promotion ladies who compete with other promotion ladies. No one has equaled her&#x2014;not nearly. And the form has died with her. It&#x2019;s just staggering how lost her standards are to the fashion world.&#x201d;<br> <br>Sitting at the front of the audience between her two bosses, wearing a Chanel suit that mixed Vreeland&#x2019;s signature color, red, with the black of mourning, the haughty Wintour, her eyes hidden behind sunglasses, gave no hint that she knew Avedon was speaking to her. But even though he saw her ascendance as a sign of the fashion Apocalypse, it&#x2019;s unlikely that even the prescient Avedon could have foreseen all the other, related forces then taking shape that would, in little more than a decade, fundamentally alter the role&#x2014;fashion photographer&#x2014;that he&#x2019;d not only mastered but embodied.</p><h2>Aleister Crowley in India: The Secret Influence of Eastern Mysticism on Magic and the Occult</h2><p>Follow Aleister Crowley through his mystical travels in India, which profoundly influenced his magical system as well as the larger occult world <br><br>� Shares excerpts from Crowley&#x2019;s unpublished diaries and details his travels in India, Burma, and Sri Lanka from 1901 to 1906 <br><br>� Reveals how Crowley incorporated what he learned in India--jnana yoga, Vedantist, Tantric, and Buddhist philosophy--into his own school of Magick <br><br>� Explores the world of Theosophy, yogis, Hindu traditions, and the first Buddhist sangha to the West as well as the first pioneering expeditions to K2 and Kangchenjunga in 1901 and 1905 <br><br>Early in life, Aleister Crowley&#x2019;s dissociation from fundamentalist Christianity led him toward esoteric and magical spirituality. In 1901, he made the first of three voyages to the Indian subcontinent, searching for deeper knowledge and experience. His religious and magical system, Thelema, shows clear influence of his thorough experimental absorption in Indian mystical practices. <br><br>Sharing excerpts from Crowley&#x2019;s unpublished diaries, Tobias Churton tells the true story of Crowley&#x2019;s adventures in India from 1901 to 1906, culminating in his first experience of the supreme trance of jnana (&#x201c;gnostic&#x201d;) yoga, Samadhi: divine union. Churton shows how Vedantist and Advaitist philosophies, Hindu religious practices, yoga, and Mahayana and Theravada Buddhism informed Crowley&#x2019;s spiritual system and reveals how he built on Madame Blavatsky and Henry Steel Olcott&#x2019;s prior work in India. Churton illuminates links between these beliefs and ancient Gnostic systems and shows how they informed the O.T.O. system through Franz Hartmann and Theodor Reuss. <br><br>Churton explores Crowley&#x2019;s early breakthrough in consciousness research with a Dhyana trance in Sri Lanka, becoming a devotee of Shiva and Bhavani, fierce avatar of the goddess Parvati. Recounting Crowley&#x2019;s travels to the temples of Madurai, Anuradhapura, and Benares, Churton looks at the gurus of yoga and astrology Crowley met, while revealing his adventures with British architect, Edward Thornton. Churton also details Crowley&#x2019;s mountaineering feats in India, including the record-breaking attempt on Chogo Ri (K2) in 1902 and the Kangchenjunga disaster of 1905. <br><br>Revealing how Crowley incorporated what he learned in India into his own school of Magick, including an extensive look at his theory of correspondences, the symbology of 777, and the Thelemic synthesis, Churton sheds light on one of the most profoundly mystical periods in Crowley&#x2019;s life as well as how it influenced the larger occult world.</p><p>Tobias Churton is Britain&#x2019;s leading scholar of Western Esotericism, a world authority on Gnosticism, Hermeticism, and Rosicrucianism.

The Aim Is Being: Calcutta<br></b><br> For leisure in Calcutta, Crowley felt it best to follow the line of least resistance and attend the races, something which interested him little, though, as in Mexico, he did take interest in the psychology of the swindler. A horse had arrived in the city tipped to be a surefire winner. Of course it attracted bets, but lost race after race, until the odds of success duly declined. Crowley calculated that having been pulled by its owners to such a degree, the time had come to bet on it. Needless to say, he won a pocketful of rupees, but obtained no satisfaction. Fathoming the bestial mind of the criminal was no joy and the winnings did not compensate. <br><br><i>My cynical disgust with the corrupt pettiness of humanity, far from being assuaged by the consciousness of my ability to outmanoeuvre it, saddened me. I loved mankind; I wanted everybody to be an enthusiastic aspirant to the absolute. I expected everybody to be as sensitive about honour as I was myself. My disillusionment drove me more and more to determine that the only thing worth doing was to save humanity from the horror of its own ignorant heartlessness. But I was still innocent to the point of imbecility. I had not analysed human conduct: I did not understand in the least the springs of human action.

Down with malaria since leaving Ceylon, ever since New Year he&#x2019;d suffered from ague, fever, indigestion, and mental depression. He sought comfort in Deussen&#x2019;s account of Vedanta, the flower of Hinduism, which, while it was certainly a progressive step from what Crowley called the &#x201c;crude animism&#x201d; of the Vedas, seemed still to push him back toward Buddhism. His diary reveals the depth of thought going on in his questing mind. <br><br><i>Jan. 13 <br><br>Early morning walk--deep meditation. Developed a sort of inverted Manichaeism.

If Nature evolves solely through selection of traits necessary for rude survival, and the &#x201c;mind&#x201d; is deemed a &#x201c;part&#x201d; of Nature, how is it that the human mind can thoroughly entertain the idea that Nature itself is a negative, or evil aspect, which, in Manichaeism, for example, is regarded in its materiality as an evil to be fled from? As for Buddhist doctrine, Nature is regarded, when we perceive it, as the home of sorrow and corruption.<br><br><i> Jan. 15. <br><br>It is a fallacy that the Absolute must be All-Good, etc. There is not an Intelligence directing law=line of least resistance.

Meanwhile, in quest of perfect detachment, Allan had taken his vows as a bhikkhu, donning the yellow robe at the Lamma Sayadaw &#x201c;Kyoung&#x201d; (or monastery) on Burma&#x2019;s west coast, at Akyab (now Sittwe). Crowley thought it a good idea to cross the Bay of Bengal to visit him, and to combine that adventure with a greater one: to cross the Arakan Hills, the barrier between the Irrawaddy valley and the coast. Reputed to be all but impassable, even the north Burmese army, when fighting the British in 1825, were not expected to survive a march through the Arakans to the east. &#x201c;I have always had this peculiar passion for putting myself in poisonous perils,&#x201d; wrote Crowley of his motive. &#x201c;Its source is presumably my congenital masochism, and the Travellers&#x2019; Tales of Paley Gardner had determined its form of expression.&#x201d; So Crowley determined to follow the initial route taken by the first British military expeditions to Burma: sail to Rangoon, then follow the Irrawaddy to Thayetmyo, north of Prome. He would then hire a guide and head west across the Arakans to Akyab, where he would surprise his Buddhist friend somewhat in the manner of Stanley and Livingstone. <br><br><i><b>Edward Thornton</b></i> <br><br>elected to join him on the adventure. Edward Thornton When Crowley averred to Thornton and himself sharing philosophical interests, he could have been thinking of a visit Crowley made in Calcutta, as Thornton&#x2019;s guest, to the famous Asiatic Society of Bengal, in which Sir William Jones had first drawn attention to Sanskrit&#x2019;s affinities with Greek and Latin, so launching the &#x201c;Aryan&#x201d; race fallacy. It was exciting for me to locate the printed &#x201c;Proceedings&#x201d; of the Society, which reveal its monthly General Meeting was held on Wednesday, January 8, 1902, at 9pm. <br><br>After the minutes were delivered, including proposals for disposing of present premises and acquiring a new site and building, the following papers were read: Rev.

Nancy Abrams, a philosopher of science, lawyer, and lifelong atheist, is among them. And yet, when she turned to the recovery community to face a personal struggle, she found that imagining a higher power gave her a new freedom. Intellectually, this was quite surprising. <br> &nbsp;<br> Meanwhile her husband, famed astrophysicist Joel Primack, was helping create a new theory of the universe based on dark matter and dark energy, and Abrams was collaborating with him on two books that put the new scientific picture into a social and political context. She wondered, &#x201c;Could anything actually exist in this strange new universe that is worthy of the name &#x2018;God?&#x2019;&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> In <i>A God That Could Be Real</i>, Abrams explores a radically new way of thinking about God. She dismantles several common assumptions about God and shows why an omniscient, omnipotent God that created the universe and plans what happens is incompatible with science&#x2014;but that this doesn&#x2019;t preclude a God that can comfort and empower us.<br> &nbsp;<br> Moving away from traditional arguments for God, Abrams finds something worthy of the name &#x201c;God&#x201d; in the new science of emergence: just as a complex ant hill emerges from the collective behavior of individually clueless ants, and just as the global economy emerges from the interactions of billions of individuals&#x2019; choices, God, she argues, is an &#x201c;emergent phenomenon&#x201d; that arises from the staggering complexity of humanity&#x2019;s collective aspirations and is in dialogue with every individual. This God did not create the universe&#x2014;it created the meaning of the universe. It&#x2019;s not universal&#x2014;it&#x2019;s planetary. It can&#x2019;t change the world, but it helps <i>us</i> change the world. A God that could be real, Abrams shows us, is what humanity needs to inspire us to collectively cooperate to protect our warming planet and create a long-term civilization.</p><p><b>Nancy Ellen Abrams</b> is coauthor with Joel R. Primack, of <i>The View from the Center of the Universe</i> and <i>The New Universe and the Human Future</i>.<b>From Chapter 2: "A God That Can't Be Real</b><br><br>Science can never tell you with certainty what&#x2019;s true, since there&#x2019;s always the possibility that some future discovery will rule it out. But science can often tell you with certainty what&#x2019;s not true. Galileo, for example, showed with telescopic evidence that the heavenly spheres could not exist, even though he could not actually prove that Earth moves around the sun. When scientists produce the evidence that convincingly rules out the impossible, there&#x2019;s no point in arguing. It&#x2019;s over. Grace lies in accepting and recalculating. That&#x2019;s how science moves forward.<br><br>What if we thought this way about God? What if we took the evidence of a new cosmic reality seriously and became willing to rule out the impossible? What if we cleared away those distracting<br>notions of God that can&#x2019;t be true in the kind of universe we actually live in? God can be imagined to do or be anything, but the goal of this book is to find a God that is real.<br><br>It&#x2019;s amazing how many unnecessary requirements have gotten tacked onto God. Unnecessary requirements are harmful. They divide us from each other, since different people see them differently; worse, they divide us from our own rational selves. A religion that credits God with powers that can&#x2019;t exist in this universe sets its followers up for inevitable doubt, which in turn requires of them an exhausting effort to jack up their faith in order to fight the evidence against it. This is self-sabotage. People are expending all that effort and worry to defend &#x201c;characteristics&#x201d; of God that no one really needs.<br><br>So here&#x2019;s a chance to pare our definition of God down to the essentials.<br><br>In my quest for a believable higher power, I decided to look one by one at the reasons God seemed unbelievable and ask if they really matter or whether they are merely traditional attributes. The results of this exercise amazed me.<br><br>Not one characteristic that conflicts with science turns out to<i> matter</i>. We can let them go.<br><br>Shakespeare said it best in<i> Richard II</i>: &#x201c;Superfluous branches we lop away that bearing boughs may live.&#x201d; Here are the branches that must be lopped away that a real God may live. These beliefs can&#x2019;t be literally true in our universe. To the extent we cling to these images, even as metaphors, we are rejecting the real universe:<br><br>1. God existed before the universe.<br>2. God created the universe.<br>3. God knows everything.<br>4. God plans what happens.<br>5. God can choose to violate the laws of nature.<br><br>I know that approaching with any level of scientific rigor something so personal, so cherished, so core touching as God may be hard at first. But the price of a real God is that we have to consciously let go of what makes it unreal. God can&#x2019;t be everything or it will be nothing. We all need hope and comfort and inspiration, but we also need the built-in bullshit detector of science.<br><br>If you&#x2019;ve never taken these five ideas literally but instead have seen God as simply a word for the sense of wonder, of the unknown, of endless possibility, of cosmic connection, and of the opportunity to not need all the answers, then it may perhaps seem silly to bother refuting them one by one. Yet I would be surprised if your sense of wonder, of the unknown cosmic connection, and endless possibility connected with the idea of God was not based on an unconscious lifelong association of God with at least some of these impossible characteristics.<br><br><i>1. God could not have existed before the universe.</i><br><br>The history of the universe tells us that complexity evolves from simpler states of being, so there could not have been an intelligence complex enough to design anything at all, let alone a universe, before cosmic evolution even began.<br><br>What I&#x2019;m about to say about the universe is based not only on direct astronomical observations but also on supercomputer simulations. The two standard ways of doing astronomy used to be theory and observation, but simulation is a new way. Direct observation of the universe in many cases is impossible, since dark matter and dark energy, which are most of the universe, are invisible, and because events on the scale of the universe happen across such vast stretches of time that a human lifetime is far too short to experience them. Theory is also inadequate because, no matter how sophisticated it may be, it can&#x2019;t predict in any detail the kind of awesome <i>transformations</i> that had to happen for primordial particles and energy to turn into galaxies, stars, and planets. But supercomputers can predict them, to a surprising degree. The availability of supercomputers is a key reason why scientific cosmology has entered a golden age.<br><br>Supercomputers enable scientists to collapse billions of years of evolution into minutes, and billions of light-years onto a computer screen. My husband&#x2019;s team of astrophysicists, for example, has several times simulated the evolution, from the Big Bang to today, of a representative cube of universe a billion light-years on a side. The team ran the simulations according to different theoretical assumptions in order to test those assumptions. The supercomputer&#x2014;the equivalent of fourteen thousand top-of-the-line Intel computers working for two months&#x2014;can track the motions of many billions of particles and cross-correlate their interactions with <i>all</i> the others for (a simulated) 13.8 billion years.<br><br>My husband&#x2019;s team then compares the final universe produced by the simulation to the real universe as telescopes directly observe it; the computers predict what the observational astronomers will find. Only if the simulated and real universes match were the initial assumptions right. They match in incredible detail.* When the simulation is not stopped at today but allowed to run, we are watching a simulation of the future of our universe.<br><br>Not only cosmology but many fields, from neuroscience to climate science, have leaped ahead since the advent of supercomputer simulation. Here, in an abbreviated and simplified form, is what<br>modern cosmology tells us about our origins.<br><br>Right after the Big Bang there was nothing but rapidly moving elementary particles and energy, not even atoms yet, though the simplest atoms, hydrogen and helium, formed after a few hundred<br>thousand years. The early universe was smooth, expanding but not turbulent. Spacetime (space and time in the universe have since Einstein been understood to be a continuum) came into existence wrinkled, and the wrinkles expanded with the universe. For billions of years primeval particles of dark matter flowed toward the wrinkles by gravitational attraction alone. The dark matter formed clumps along the wrinkles through a process that astronomers enigmatically call &#x201c;violent relaxation.&#x201d; Up to here, our cosmic history was simple, governed by pure physics. Scientists deeply understand that era. But as time passed, enormous transformations came about,<br>and the complexity that resulted is much harder to understand. The immense gravity of the dark matter clumps drew in clouds of hydrogen and helium, which cooled and collapsed to the centers of the clumps, igniting as stars. Surrounded by a halo of dark matter, the stars cooked up inside themselves the heavier atoms, like oxygen, carbon, nitrogen, silicon, and the nearly a hundred natural atoms that are heavier than helium and make up most of the periodic table of the elements. The biggest stars exploded in supernovas and spewed these heavy atoms into space as pure stardust to soar for eons. The intermingling stardust of thousands of supernovas, which had occurred over many eras, got pulled into the gravitational field of our forming solar system, and 4.6 billion years ago the stardust condensed into the rocky planets, including Earth. Hundreds of millions of years passed before the earliest life evolved here, and billions more before intelligence evolved that was complex enough to understand the idea of creation. The evolution of such complexity takes a long time.<br><br>This is the kind of universe we live in. This is where our thinking should start.<br><br>Something as complex as a mind capable of planning and creating the universe could not possibly have been there to do so.<br><br>What&#x2019;s more, it&#x2019;s not clear where &#x201c;there&#x201d; would be, since cosmologists are continually pushing back the beginning. The Big Bang used to be thought of as the beginning, but the larger theory of cosmic inflation now explains what set up the initial conditions for the Big Bang and caused the wrinkles that later attracted dark matter. The theory of cosmic inflation has made five specific predictions, and the four that have been tested so far have all been confirmed by observation, so the theory has become part of the standard model of cosmology. Astrophysicists have also extrapolated backward from cosmic inflation, theorizing what may have happened before. This theory is called eternal inflation, and it posits a pure quantum state of being outside our universe that, once begun, can never stop and may continue eternally, producing multiple universes, including ours. Where, in that case, would the beginning be?<br><br>Let&#x2019;s suppose the theory of eternal inflation turns out to be right. Does eternal into the future require eternal into the past? Not clear. It&#x2019;s not even clear what &#x201c;eternal into the past&#x201d; might mean. In eternal inflation not even an atom can form. No information can be preserved in any way, and thus no meaningful past could exist.<br><br>Furthermore, &#x201c;eternal into the future&#x201d; is not even a meaningful concept <i>inside</i> our universe. The largest structures in our universe are called superclusters of galaxies. They will exist for many billions more years, but gradually the dark energy that&#x2019;s causing the universe to expand faster and faster will tear them apart. Unlike superclusters of galaxies, our own galaxy, the Milky Way, is bound together by gravity, which will permanently prevent dark energy from tearing it apart. Instead our Milky Way will merge in five billion years or so with our neighboring large galaxy, Andromeda, and tens of smaller nearby galaxies will also fall into the forming megagalaxy that we might call Milky Andromeda. New stars will keep forming, and Milky Andromeda will shine on for a <i>trillion</i> more years, hundreds of times longer than Earth has existed. That&#x2019;s pretty close to eternal&#x2014;but not the same.<br><br>The fact is, &#x201c;in the beginning&#x201d; is no more precise than &#x201c;once upon a time.&#x201d; The beginning is just a line we draw in our minds to be able to start telling a story. The end is a line we draw to stop. They have no objective reality. They can&#x2019;t even be defined, let alone explained. So demanding to know the very beginning of the universe is as misguided as trying to understand the last moment of the universe.<br><br>*You can watch visualizations of these simulations on the website for the most recent book I coauthored with my husband, The New Universe and the Human Future, http://new<br>-universe.org.</p><h2>Smooth Operator (A Teddy Fay Novel featuring Stone Barrington)</h2><p>Summoned to Washington for a situation that requires the help of ex-CIA agent and master of disguise Teddy Fay, Stone Barrington oversees an operation that is complicated by Fay&#39;s maverick approaches and personal brand of justice.</p><p>Stuart Woods is the author of more than sixty novels.

"The man you used to be involved with?"</p><p>"He's not coming to see me, he's coming to see Kate. I have to take care of Congressman Jenkins, from East Podunk."</p><p>"Sweetheart-"</p><p>"I'm sorry. I'll make it up to you. I'm just in a bind."</p><p>Paul kept her on the phone as long as he dared, picking up as many details as possible, most of them silly and inconsequential, like tracking Stone down on the Hudson River and having to get a tux made at the last minute. Paul needed all the information he could get. It had seemed like a cushy job, cozying up to the attractive White House chief of staff, and he was happy to do it, but they weren't going to keep paying him unless he had something to show for it.</p><p>Paul had no idea whether this particular tidbit was worth anything, but evaluating the intel wasn't his job.

Salih was young and inexperienced, but his inexperience was what made him valuable. He was on no watch lists, nor was he likely to be. An American citizen, the son of upstanding convenience store owners, he had no blot on his record.</p><p>"Are you ready?" Abdul-Hakim said.</p><p>"Yes," Salih said.</p><p>Abdul-Hakim was sure he was. It was Abdul-Hakim's job to know, just as it was his job to know every aspect of the operation. A handsome, clean-cut, Middle-Eastern man in an Armani suit, Abdul-Hakim could have passed for a corporate CEO. In fact, he could have passed for many things, and did.</p><p>"One more thing," Abdul-Hakim said.</p><p>"What's that?"</p><p>Abdul-Hakim placed a box of rifle shells on the table. "Use these."</p><p>"Why?"</p><p>Abdul-Hakim's smile was frosty. "Because I am asking you to. Use them, and leave the expended shell casing behind."</p><p>He reached in his jacket pocket, took out an ID, and slid it across the table. "This is also for you. A driver's license, in the name of Nehan Othman. This is what you will present at security, so they will not have a record of your name."</p><p>"I understand."</p><p>Abdul-Hakim slid a fat envelope across the table. "Ten thousand now, ten thousand more when it is done. I will not see you again until it is over." He stood up.</p><p>Salih stood also. "I will walk you out."</p><p>"No, you will not. You will wait here at least ten minutes before you even stick your head out the door."</p><p>Salih sat back down.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Abdul-Hakim's cellphone rang as he came out the front door of the apartment house. He pulled it out of his pocket, and looked at the Caller ID. It was the money man, the man paying him to set up and run the whole complicated operation. What could he possibly want now?</p><p>Abdul-Hakim tried to keep the irritation out of his voice. "I just spoke to him. We're all set."</p><p>"Something came up."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><br><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>3</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Stone was ushered off the helicopter into a black limo driven by a liveried youth who looked barely tall enough to reach the gas pedal. He took off without a word and without even glancing at his passenger, drove skillfully into downtown DC, and pulled up in front of the exclusive tailor shop of Henry Cassini. A sign on the door said &#x201c;closed,&#x201d; but the lights were on inside. This was not unusual. Cassini lived above the shop and often worked late.</p><p>Before Stone could even ring the bell the door was yanked open by the tailor himself. An older man with sculptured white hair who was always impeccably dressed in finer suits of his own design, Cassini had a reputation for being genial and deferential to his customers. Tonight, however, he seemed slightly hassled.</p><p>"Come in, come in. I just finished." He cast an appraising eye over Stone and nodded. "They got the measurements right. Good. It's in the changing room. Put it on and come out."</p><p>The tux fit perfectly, as did the shoes supplied with it. Stone adjusted the bow tie and stepped out into the shop.</p><p>Cassini was pacing anxiously. "Let me see, let me see. Ah. Yes. Perfect. Turn around. Good. They got it right. You're all set. Take your wallet and keys, anything else you need. Your clothes will be sent on to your hotel.&#x201d;</p><p>Cassini ushered Stone back out the front door, where the driver was waiting by the car. Stone hopped in and, once more, the driver took off without a word, and headed for the White House.</p><p>Stone settled back in the seat and watched as the lights flashed by in the gathering darkness. It was late for a White House dinner. He'd have missed the reception and would be lucky to get a cocktail before sitting down.</p><p>Stone felt himself tensing up. And it wasn't just the thought of keeping the president waiting. Kate Lee was a friend, wouldn&#x2019;t think him rude in any case, even if she hadn't summoned him peremptorily at the last minute. No, something else was wrong.</p><p>The car took a right-hand turn, and Stone realized what it was. The car behind followed them into the turn. It had been following them for some time.</p><p>"Take a left at the light," Stone said.</p><p>The driver was startled just to be spoken to. He half turned in his seat. "That isn't the way."</p><p>"Don't turn around. Just keep driving. Do what I say. I know you have your orders. I'm countermanding them. If you don't want to listen to me, tomorrow you can spend your last day on the job hearing a lot of people tell you why you should have."</p><p>"What's going on?"</p><p>"We're being followed. Don't turn around! Don't do anything out of the ordinary. Take a left at the light if you want to make sure. Watch the rearview mirror. When the lights come with us, you'll know I'm right."</p><p>The driver turned left at the light.</p><p>The car followed.</p><p>"Oh, my God!"</p><p>"Take it easy. Don't speed up or slow down. Don't react at all. Get back on course."</p><p>The driver made two rights and a left, coming out on the street they'd been on before.</p><p>The other car came with them.</p><p>"Who are they?"</p><p>"I don't know. Let's assume they're friendly until they prove differently."</p><p>"Like how?"</p><p>"Like that," Stone said, ducking low in his seat.</p><p>The block was dark. The window on the passenger's side slid down, and a long barrel emerged. The barrel flashed. A burst of gunfire shattered the rear window of the limo.</p><p>"Stay low!" Stone warned. "Do you have a gun?"</p><p>The driver was horrified. "No."</p><p>"Neither do I. All right, I have to get out."</p><p>"Now?"</p><p>"Yes, or t...</p></p><h2>The Store (Library of Alabama Classics)</h2><p><p>The Pulitzer prize-winning <i>The Store</i> is the second novel of Stribling&#x2019;s monumental trilogy set in the author&#x2019;s native Tennessee Valley region of north Alabama. The action begins in 1884, the year in which Grover Cleveland became the first Democratic president since the end of the Civil War; and it centers about the emergence of a figure of wealth in the city of Florence.<br><br>In <i>The Store</i>, Stribling succeeds in presenting the essence of an age through the everyday lives of his characters. In the <i>New Yorker</i>, reviewer Robert M. Coates compared Stribling with Mark Twain in his ability to convey the &#x201c;very life and movement&#x201d; of a small Southern town: &#x201c;Groups move chatting under the trees or stand loitering in the courthouse square, townsfolk gather at political &#x2018;speakings&#x2019; and drift homeward separately afterward; always, in their doings, one has the sense of a whole community surrounding them, binding them together.&#x201d; Gerald Bullet wrote in <i>The New Statesman and Nation</i> that the novel &#x201c;is a first-rate book...filled with diverse and vital characters; and much of it cannot be read without that primitive excitement, that eagerness to know what comes next, which is, after all, the triumph of the good story teller.&#x201d;</p><br></p><p><b>Randy K.

For more information, please visit www.peterbenchley.com.1<br><br>The girl lay on the surface of the sea, looking into the water through a mask, and was afraid.<br><br>She was surprised to feel fear--a true, deep fear that bordered on panic--for not in years had anything in the sea frightened her.<br><br>But then, never in her life had she been actively, aggressively menaced by an animal. Creatures had snapped at her, and some had circled her, hungry and curious, but always a show of strength and confidence had sent them on their way in search of more appropriate prey.<br><br>But this animal did not seem to want to bite her, or eat her. It looked to her as if it wanted simply to hurt her, to stab her.<br><br>It had appeared with magical speed. One moment the girl was gazing into an empty blue haze; the next, she was staring at a sharp and pointed bill of bone that quivered three feet from her chest. The bill swooped back to a broadened base, and ended in two clam-size black eyes as cold as night.<br><br>Unlike the other billfish, this one had no fin on its back. It had instead a dorsal sail covering most of its backbone, which could lie flat against the back and be almost invisible, or stand in proud display.<br><br>Or, when the fish was agitated, as now, the sail pulsed up and down, up and down, as the head of a serpent hypnotizes a rodent.<br><br>The fish's tail was like a honed scythe. It twitched once, a shudder passed along the body, and the bill jerked quickly, startling the girl.<br><br>She did not know what to do, how to behave. Backing away was no answer: This was not territorial aggression, for this was not a territorial animal. It cruised the deep water of the open sea; it knew no home.<br><br>To move suddenly at it was no answer: The fish was supremely confident of its superiority over her--in speed and strength and agility--or it would not have approached her. She could not hope to shoo it away.<br><br>And to stay where she was seemed to be no answer: Apparently, she was somehow irritating the fish, for it shook its head, and its spear sliced the water and she felt its force against her chest.<br><br>Its long, slim pectoral fins dropped; its back hunched; its tail twitched. Its entire body was a cocked spring, ready, at the release of an inner trigger, to impale her on its bill.<br><br>Why?<br><br>It could not be pure malice, for her father had taught her that malice did not exist in animals. Animals could be hungry, angry, frightened, hurt, sick, defensive, protective, jealous, careless, or playful--and in any of those states could become vicious or violent--but not malevolent.<br><br>What, then? What did it want?<br><br>Again the head shook, and the spear slit the water.<br><br>She wondered if she could make it to her boat before the fish attacked. She fluttered her fingers and toes, hoping to propel herself backward, inch by inch, closer to her boat.<br><br>But how far away was the boat?<br><br>She turned her head a half-turn, flicked her eyes over her shoulder, saw the boat, and turned immediately back to face the fish.<br><br>It was gone.<br><br>She had felt nothing, heard nothing, and now all she could see was the endless blue.<br>2<br><br>There was no electricity on the island, and kerosene lamps burned with a thick, greasy smoke that made some people sick, so the old man and the girl chose to sit in a room illuminated only by the light that leaked around the edges of the covered windows. The old man kept the room dark intentionally, had put cloths over the windows, because the slashing rays of the late-afternoon sun colored the room with contrasts so sharp that they pained his eyes and confused him. He had cataracts in both eyes, and sudden bursts of bright light felt like little explosions in his brain.<br><br>The old man's name was Francisco, but everyone called him Viejo, Old Man, even the children who might have called him Grandfather or a pet name, because Viejo was an honor, a title as significant as Excellency or General. To attain old age was a true achievement.<br><br>The girl's name was Paloma-Dove--after the morning bird that cooed a prelude to the cock's crow. She was sixteen.<br><br>"I don't understand, Viejo," she said. "Nothing like that has ever happened to me before."<br><br>"You had never met a bad animal before. Now you have. It had to happen, eventually."<br><br>"Forgive me, but . . ." She hesitated. "Papa always told me there was no such thing as a bad animal."<br><br>"Your father Jobim was a . . . a curious man." Viejo sought gentle words to describe his son-in-law, rather than those that came quickly to mind. "Of course there are bad animals, just as there are bad people. I am only grateful that the sailfish you met today was not truly bad, or he would have run you through. That happens. Once, many years before you were born . . ."<br><br>To forestall the reminiscence, Paloma said, "I don't see why God would create a bad animal. It doesn't make sense."<br><br>Viejo pressed his lips together, which Paloma recognized as a sign of pique. He was a fine storyteller, and it was one of the few pleasures that life still permitted him.<br><br>"Who says you must understand everything?" Viejo said. "For a human being to try to fathom all of God's works is a waste of time."<br><br>Paloma tried to retreat. "I didn't mean . . ."<br><br>"What is, is. And one of the things that is, is that there are good things and bad things." He paused. "They tell me you have been interfering with the fishermen again."<br><br>"No! I only . . ."<br><br>"They say you shout and make a fool of yourself."<br><br>"They can think what they please. All I did was ask Jo and Indio and the others why they can't be more careful. They catch everything; they bring back fish they have no use for. They don't kill just for food. That I could understand. The way they fish, someday there will be nothing left."<br><br>"No. The sea is forever. And you must learn that man will hunt what he wishes for whatever reason he wishes. His judgments are his own. For example, it has been judged that some animals are good alive and dead, like the bonito and the tuna and the grouper. Alive, they feed other animals; dead, they feed people and still more animals, useful animals. Some animals are bad, like the sea snake and the stonefish and the scorpion. All they do is cause pain and death.<br><br>"And then there are animals both good and bad, like barracuda--which one day feeds a man handsomely and the next day poisons him--and like sharks. Sharks bring us food and money, true, but now and again they kill people."<br><br>"What about an angelfish?" Paloma asked. "What could be good or bad about an angelfish? Or a pufferfish? Indio caught a pufferfish the other day, and you'd think he had caught a marlin. Why? We don't sell them. We don't eat them."<br><br>"The fishermen make their living from the sea," said Viejo, "and so they must become one with the sea and all its creatures. Sometimes, the only way to come to know a creature is to catch and kill it."<br><br>Because Paloma did not want to distress or offend her grandfather, she did not argue further: His truths were unshakable. So, all she said was, "Well, I hope nothing ever wants to get to know me that well."<br>Outside Paloma looked to the western sky. The sun hovered over the horizon, as if about to be sucked beneath the shiny gray water.<br><br>She hurried to her rock, a narrow shelf of stone that jutted out over the western tip of the island. She came here at this time every day, and she loved both the place and the time of day, for this was where she felt at peace, close to nature, to life.<br><br>There were a few clouds overhead, and the setting sun painted them pink, but the horizon was cloudless, a blade beneath the red fireball that was slowly sliding downward and seeming to squash oblong.<br><br>Tonight might be a night for the green flash, she thought, and she steadied her chin in her hands and forced herself not to blink as she fastened her eyes on the vanishing sun. You almost never saw the green flash: The evening had to be clear and almost chilly; no waves of heat could be shimmering up from the water; the horizon had to be sharp and without even a wisp of cloud. And, of course, you had to be there and alert, and you couldn't blink, because the green flash lasted only that tiny bit of a second as the last infinitesimal rim of sun dipped below the horizon. Many times she had missed it by blinking, and in all her life she had seen it only twice--the first time the evening long ago when her father had led her by the hand and shown her this special place.<br><br>The bottom of the sun touched the horizon, and Paloma half expected to hear a hiss as the water quenched the fire, or see a cloud of steam explode from the sea. But smoothly and without a sound, it slipped faster and faster out of the sky.<br><br>Paloma held her breath and opened her eyes as wide as she could. The last of the sun dropped away and then, as Paloma was beginning to think there would be no green flash tonight, there it was--a shining pinprick of brilliant green, gone so fast that it became a memory at almost the same instant it registered as a sight.<br><br>Paloma watched the sky for a moment more, enjoying the changes that happened with such speed only at the beginning and end of the day. The yellow light was fading, following the sun to other parts of the world. The sky overhead was darkening quickly and soon was speckled with stars, and only the faintest splash of pink still touched the clouds.<br><br>Paloma felt suddenly calm and happy. Seeing the green flash was supposed to be an omen of good fortune, and though she didn't really believe in omens, surely it was better to have seen it than not to have seen it.<br><br>She rose to her knees and was about to leave the rock when a flicker of movement made her look back at the water. What she saw made her stop and stare and catch her breath again.<br><br>Rising clear of the water, outlined against the lapis sky, twisting in a spasm of pure pleasure, was an enormous marlin. Its saber blade sliced through the air, its sickle tail arched upward, and then, in graceful slow motion, the huge body slammed down upon the water.<br><br>It was a full second before Paloma heard the heavy, resonant boom, and by then all that remained as testimony to the acrobatics was a spreading ring of ripples on the sea.<br><br>That, Paloma thought, was definitely something special. Maybe nature is telling me I should believe in omens.<br><br>With a feeling of privilege, of being witness to nature reveling in itself, Paloma started for home. As she walked along the path, she looked down and saw her brother, Jo, and his two friends approaching the dock in their skiff.<br><br>Paloma could see from the top of the hill that they had had a good day. The bow of their boat was heaped high with fish, a kaleidoscope of glistening colors in the fading light. And Paloma could see, even from where she stood, that they had taken fish indiscriminately: Whatever they could catch they had killed. There were angelfish and rockfish, bonitos and jacks, pufferfish and stingrays, and even one of the rare and strange and furtive creatures called guitar sharks--harmless and, to fishermen, useless. Those fish that would not take a hook had been harpooned. Those that had eluded the harpoon had been netted.<br><br>As Paloma watched, Jo shut off the outboard motor and guided the wallowing skiff toward the dock, while his mates culled the piles of dead fish with their fingers, throwing overboard those that were not worth selling.<br><br>When Paloma had first seen them do this, she had erupted in fury, screaming at Jo, demanding to know why, if they intended to throw back the fish, they didn't do so as soon as they caught them, when the fish still had a chance to live.<br><br>If Jo had been startled at her anger, he had nevertheless been forthright in his response. "Early in the day, before we know the size of the catch, any fish is a good fish. By the end of the day, if the catch has been rich we can afford to keep only the good ones. So then we throw the bad ones back."<br><br>Paloma had tried to argue, but Jo had walked away, saying that was the way things had always been, and that was the way they would remain.<br><br>Now, she watched as the one called Indio picked up a small fish by its eye sockets and waved it at the other mate, Manolo. Though she was still a distance from them and the twilight was deepening, she could tell them apart by the color of their hair. Indio always wore a hat on the boat, so his hair had remained black. Manolo kept his head cool by pouring salt water on it, so his hair had been bleached to a light brown, just as Paloma's own long auburn hair had been bleached nearly blond by salt and sun. Indio said something now and threw the fish at Manolo, who picked up another fish by its tail and whacked Indio on the head with it.<br><br>Yowling and cursing, the fishermen flung fish at one another. Most missed their targets and landed in the water, to float there belly up.<br><br>To Paloma, striding down the hill, the fight was nauseating, the waste obscene. It offended something deep inside her to see dead animals treated as if they had never been live beings.<br><br>She bent over and picked up a rock and called out, "Hey!" The three in the skiff looked up. "If you have to throw things at each other, throw these." And she cocked her arm and threw the rock as hard as she could, hoping it would strike the skiff and knock a hole in it. But the rock flew wide and plopped in the water, and Jo responded by laughing and ticking his thumbnail off his front teeth and pointing at her--the coarsest, most insulting, and most contemptuous gesture he could make.<br><br>Paloma turned away.<br><br>Her father had explained the problem to her many times, during those early days when she had first complained about the young men who fished without care, taking everything and wasting much. "The sea, this sea, is too rich," he had said. "It has too much life."</p><h2>The Old Woman Who Lived in a Vinegar Bottle</h2><p>A poor old woman finds good fortune when she returns a fish she has bought to the sea</p><p><p>Rumer Godden (1908 -- 1998) was one of the UK's most notable writers.

With presidential approval by John F. Kennedy himself, Moore went to a place called Vietnam--and was never the same again.This monumental, bestselling work--the inspiration for the classic movie starring John Wayne and one of the first wake-up called given to the American public about Vietnam--plunges us into the chaos that was our nation&#39;s first experience with unconventional warfare.From fighting the Viet Cong to fighting alongside Montagnard tribesmen, The Green Berets captures the terror of fire fights and iambuses, the constant confusion between friend and foe and the amazing can-do spirit of U.S. Special Forces &#34;advisors&#34; who changed the shape of war even as it changed them.

True to his Halloween birthdate, Robin's choice of topics have frequently leaned toward the supernatural and macabre. <p>Robin was raised in Concord, Massachusetts and attended Middlesex School and Belmont Hill School. After graduating from Belmont Hill, he joined the armed forces and flew a tour of combat missions over Germany during the closing days of World War II. He graduated from Harvard College in 1949 and went to New York to produce television shows. In 1952 he returned to Boston to work for the Sheraton Hotel Company co-founded by his father, Robert Lowell Moore senior. But, what Robin really wanted to do was write. </p><p>His first novel, Pitchman was about the burgeoning TV business. He continued to work for Sheraton and as a result of trying to establish Sheraton hotels in the Caribbean in the late 50s he ran across Fidel Castro which led to his chronicling the Cuban communist dictator's guerrilla campaign in a non-fiction book The Devil To Pay. A third novel about Robin's family business, Hotel Tomayne, brought about the end of his career in hotel management and was the start of his full-time writing career. </p><p>In 1963 his Harvard classmate, Robert Kennedy, President John F. Kennedy's brother, made it possible for Robin to join the US Army Special Forces as a civilian. Robin went through almost a year of training and then went to Vietnam with the Special Forces and wrote his definitive novel of the Vietnam War, The Green Berets which was published in May of 1965. </p><p>The French Connection followed this first success when Robin joined the New York police department in one of their most spectacular drug busts. Robin continued to write and his next big hit was The Happy Hooker with Xaviera Hollander, the story of the most controversial madam in New York City. </p><p>Robin then went on to write many more novels about international intrigue and adventure. He often traveled internationally to gather background material for his books. </p><p>Robin returned to Southeast Asia to write The Country Team about American diplomacy and Green Beret operations in Asia. The Khaki Mafia was next, chronicling the adventures of a beautiful, blond Australian girl's adventures as an entertainer and talent booker to US Army posts throughout Vietnam. </p><p>A stint as a treasure hunter in the Caribbean led to The Treasure Hunter. In the 70s Robin spent a year in Iran and the middle east researching his next novel, Dubai, an epic of gold smuggling, oil exploration, and political subversion in the Arab world. Two novels of gambling followed. The first was the story of a great con game, The Big Paddle and the other was the heartbreaking tale of a compulsive gambler, Compulsion. Robin returned to his hotel background in The Fifth Estate. </p><p>One of his more recent novels, The White Tribe, was the result of three years spent in Africa observing American and European mercenaries fighting communist terrorism.

I still cannot write by hand without focusing on each letter as I form it, and even then, some letters are out of order, or left out entirely. My mother saw this early on and began to work on reading with me when I was two. I spent long afternoons on her lap, learning to sound out words. We practiced letters as though no shapes could ever be lovelier than theirs. To keep my attention, she gave me a notebook with a yellow felt cover on which Winnie-the-Pooh and Tigger were sewn. We made flash cards and played games with them. I loved the attention, and my mother brought a sense of fun to her teaching.<br> <br>When I was six, my parents applied to eleven schools in New York City, and all eleven turned me down. Despite my advanced reading skills, my test scores said I would never learn to read and write. Only a year later did the principal of one school overrule the exam results so that I could be enrolled.<br> <br>That early victory over dyslexia taught my family that with patience, love, intelligence, and will, we could defeat a neurological abnormality. Unfortunately, it also set the stage for our later struggle. It made it hard to believe that we couldn&#x2019;t correct something else that was perceived as abnormal&#x2014;my being gay.<br> <br>�&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;&nbsp;�<br> <br>People ask when I knew I was gay, and I wonder what that means. Recent studies have shown that as early as age two, many boys who will grow up to be gay avoid some rough-and-tumble play. By age six, a good number behave in some ways that aren&#x2019;t typical &#x201c;boy.&#x201d; I knew that many things I liked were unmasculine: I never traded a baseball card, but instead shared the plots of operas on the school bus, which did not make me popular.<br> <br>I was popular at home, but I was also corrected. Once, when I was about seven, I was leaving a shoe store with my mother and brother, and the salesman asked us what color balloons we&#x2019;d like to take home. My brother wanted a red balloon. I wanted a pink one. My mother said that I did not want a pink balloon. She announced, over my protests, that my favorite color was blue, so I ended up taking a blue balloon. The fact that in adulthood my favorite color is blue stands as evidence of my mother&#x2019;s influence; the fact that I am still gay is evidence of its limits.<br> <br>Though it was supposed to be integrated, my grade-school class actually included only a few black and Latino kids, and they mostly socialized with one another. My first year at school was second grade, and when Debbie Camacho had a birthday party in Spanish Harlem, my mother made me go. I was one of only two white kids who went, out of a class of forty; none of my friends was there and I was terrified. Debbie&#x2019;s cousins tried to get me to dance. Everyone spoke Spanish, the food was unfamiliar, and I had a kind of panic attack and went home in tears.<br> <br>I didn&#x2019;t see the parallels between everyone else&#x2019;s avoidance of Debbie&#x2019;s party and my own unpopularity. It never occurred to me that she and I had anything in common. It was only years later that I understood why my mother had made me go, and recognized that it was a moral issue. Then I was glad to have been there: It was the right thing to do. Debbie&#x2019;s party was the beginning of my tolerance toward people who were different from me, and that attitude ultimately helped me understand that I was okay even though I was different.<br> <br>A few months after Debbie&#x2019;s party, Bobby Finkel had a birthday and invited everyone in the class but me. My mother called his mother, sure that there had been a mistake. Mrs. Finkel said that Bobby didn&#x2019;t like me and didn&#x2019;t want me there. My mother picked me up after school on the day of the party and took me to the zoo and out for a hot fudge sundae. Now I can see how hurt my mother must have been for me&#x2014;more hurt than I was, or let myself notice I was. She knew that being different had sad consequences, and she wanted to protect me.<br> <br>Making me choose the blue balloon had been partly an effort to shelter me and partly an act of aggression. In many ways, my mother encouraged me to be myself, and she made me believe I could be loved for who I was rather than for who the larger world suggested I should be. But at the same time, she wanted to change me in ways that I couldn&#x2019;t be changed. That made me angry; it still does. The hardest thing to make sense of was the fact that the love was real even though it coincided with the rejection of a central part of me.<br> <br>I floundered in the tricky waters of elementary school, but at home, away from the cruelty, my quirks were mostly humored. When I was ten, I became fascinated by the tiny European country of Liechtenstein. A year later my father took us along on a business trip to Switzerland, and one morning my mother announced that she&#x2019;d arranged for us all to drive to Liechtenstein. The same mother who forbade the pink balloon took us to lunch in a charming caf�, on a tour of the art museum, and to visit the printing office where they made the country&#x2019;s gorgeous postage stamps, just to indulge my weird fascination.<br> <br>Still, there were limits, and pink balloons fell on the wrong side of them. My parents&#x2019; rule was to be interested in others from within a pact of sameness. I wanted to do more than just be interested in the whole world: I wanted to be a part of it. I wanted to dive for pearls, memorize Shakespeare, break the sound barrier. Maybe I wanted to transform myself because I wanted to break away from my family&#x2019;s way of being. Maybe I was already trying to get closer to who I wanted to become.<br> <br>�&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;&nbsp;�<br> <br>In 1993, I was assigned to investigate Deaf culture for the New York Times. I thought of deafness as a defect. Most deaf children are born to hearing parents&#x2014;parents who often think deafness is a tragedy, and throw themselves into making sure their deaf children learn to speak and read lips. Teaching those skills usually takes so much time and energy that parents neglect other areas of their children&#x2019;s education. Some deaf people become very good at speech and lip-reading over time, but at the expense of learning history and math, and they end up fairly uneducated.<br> <br>Some kids stumble upon Deaf identity as teenagers, and it makes them feel free and powerful. They move into a world that uses Sign as a language and they become proud of the same things about themselves that used to embarrass their parents. Some hearing parents accept this confident new identity, but others struggle against it.<br> <br>I understood this complex process of self-discovery because I am gay. Gay people usually grow up with straight parents, who often believe that their children would be better off straight. Frequently, they pressure their kids to be or act straight. These kids discover gay identity as teenagers or later, and it comes as a huge relief. So the line between illness (the negative way of looking at a condition) and identity (the positive way of looking at it) is never clear. Something you start out considering as an illness can become a cornerstone of your identity. Also, what some people think of as an illness, others think of as an identity. And the same attribute can be defined as an illness at one time, then in a different historical time it can change to an identity. Sometimes, it can be an identity and an illness at the same time, even for the person who has the condition.<br> <br>When I started writing about the deaf, the surgical insertion of a device called a cochlear implant, which can offer something similar to hearing, was a recent innovation. Its supporters said it was a miracle cure for a terrible defect. The Deaf community saw it as an attack on their culture. The issue is complicated by the fact that cochlear implants are most successful when they are introduced in infants, meaning that the decision is made by parents before the child can possibly weigh in with an opinion.<br> <br>My parents would have said yes to a childhood operation that would have made me straight. If such a process is ever invented, I think most of gay culture would be wiped out within a generation. That thought makes me terribly sad.<br> <br>But it has taken time for me to value my own life. I, too, once wished to be straight. While I have come to understand the richness of Deaf culture, I know that before I did this research, I would have assumed that the only thing to do for a deaf child would be to fix the abnormality.<br> <br>A few years after I began spending time in the Deaf community, a friend gave birth to a daughter who was a dwarf, and she had a lot of questions. Should she raise her daughter to believe that she was just like everyone else, only shorter? Or should she make sure that her daughter had dwarf role models and developed a dwarf identity? Or should she consider surgery to lengthen her daughter&#x2019;s limbs? I saw a pattern that was becoming familiar.<br> <br>First I had found common ground with the Deaf, and now I felt the same way about a dwarf. Who else was out there waiting to join us kids who were different, and whose parents had a hard time figuring out what to do about it?<br> <br>�&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;&nbsp;�<br> <br>Because genes and cultural habits get passed down from one generation to the next, most of us share at least some traits with our parents. These are vertical identities, like the trunk of the family tree. Ethnicity, for example, is a vertical identity. Children of color are born to parents of color. Language is usually vertical, since people who speak Greek as a first language usually raise their children to speak Greek too, even if those children also speak another language some of the time. Nationality is vertical, except for immigrants. Nearsightedness and blond hair are often passed from parent to child, but neither one is an important basis for identity&#x2014;nearsightedness because it is easily corrected, and blond hair because what&#x2019;s in style shifts all the time, and besides, you can change your hair color easily, many times over.<br> <br>But what happens when something about you is so completely alien to your parents that you have to learn your identity outside of your family? This is a horizontal identity, one that does not show up on the intergenerational family tree. These identities can come from a recessive gene, a random genetic mutation, or values and preferences that you don&#x2019;t share with your parents. Being gay is a horizontal identity because most gay kids are not born to gay parents. They need to learn about being gay by observing and taking part in a subculture. Physical disabilities and genius are both usually horizontal identities. Mental illness is also usually horizontal. So are conditions such as autism and intellectual disabilities. Even being a psychopath is a horizontal identity. Most criminals weren&#x2019;t raised by gang members; they have to invent their own identity outside of their families.<br> <br>In the twenty-first-century United States, it is sometimes still hard to be black or Asian or Jewish or female, but no one suggests that all people should try to turn themselves into white Christian men. Many vertical identities make people uncomfortable, and yet we don&#x2019;t try to eliminate them. Instead, over time, we recognize the flaws in our society that have made these conditions difficult for the people who have them. We try to fix the society, not to change the Asians or Jews or women or African-Americans. Parents teach these children a sense of pride about who they are, even when the larger society is divided by prejudice.<br> <br>The disadvantages of being gay are no greater than those of believing in a minority religion, but many parents have long tried to turn their gay children straight. Many parents also rush to make certain kinds of physical differences &#x201c;normal.&#x201d; Some children&#x2019;s minds are labeled as diseased&#x2014;with autism, intellectual disabilities, or transgenderism&#x2014;in part because those minds make their parents uncomfortable. Things get corrected that would be better left alone.<br> <br>�&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;&nbsp;�<br> <br>My parents misunderstood who I was, and I have come to believe that all parents sometimes misunderstand the core nature of their own children. Many parents see a child&#x2019;s horizontal identity as an insult. Those same children are also different from most of their peers. They&#x2019;re not accepted at home or in the world. Families tend to support and encourage vertical identities. Horizontal ones, however, are often treated as failings.<br> <br>We use the word illness to criticize a way of being, and identity to validate a way of being. Many conditions can be viewed as both an illness and an identity. Just as in physics, where we&#x2019;ve learned that energy is sometimes a wave and sometimes a particle, we need to come up with a new vocabulary for conditions that can be both illness and identity.<br> <br>I thought that if the identity of being gay could grow out of homosexuality, which used to be considered an illness; and if the identity of Deafness could grow out of deafness, which has been widely considered a disability; and if the identity of dwarfism could emerge from what was considered an apparent deformity, then there must be other categories in this awkward in-between territory. Instead of being in a marginal minority, I was suddenly in vast company. Each of these experiences&#x2014;deafness, gayness, and dwarfism, among many others&#x2014;can isolate those who are affected, but together our struggles and differences connect us. Everybody is different in one way or another. It&#x2019;s the one thing we all have in common.<br> <br>The children I describe in this book have horizontal conditions that their parents find strange and alien. They are deaf or dwarfs; they have Down syndrome, autism, schizophrenia, or severe disabilities; they are prodigies; they are people born out of rape, or people who commit crimes; they are transgender.<br> <br>There&#x2019;s an old saying that the apple doesn&#x2019;t fall far from the tree, meaning children tend to be like their parents. The children in this book are apples that have fallen elsewhere&#x2014;some a couple of orchards away, some on the other side of the world. Yet many of these children learn to embrace their horizontal identities, and help their families to tolerate, accept, and even celebrate them.<br> <br>All children are startling to their parents. I have yet to meet any parent who doesn&#x2019;t sometimes look at his or her child and think, &#x201c;What planet did you come from?&#x201d; I&#x2019;ve yet to meet a child who hasn&#x2019;t sometimes wondered the same thing about his or her parents. So these dramatic situations expand on a theme. By learning more about exceptional cases, we can start to understand the universal phenomenon of difference within families.<br> <br>You need three levels of acceptance: self-acceptance, family acceptance, and acceptance by the larger society. It&#x2019;s important to know how autistic people feel about autism, or dwarfs about dwarfism. Self-acceptance is critical. But compassion and empathy begin at home. Most of the parents and children I have written about love one another across the divide of their differences. When they look deep into their child&#x2019;s eyes, parents can see both a reflection of themselves and someone entirely strange, and still love their child completely. Children can look back and feel the same combination of reassuring sameness, confusing differences, and overpowering love. The society at large will often take its cues from the family and the self. There is more imagination in the world than one might think.<br> <br>�&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;&nbsp;�<br> <br>Most kids want to be like other kids. That was...</p><h2>The path of purification : Visuddhimagga</h2><p>One of Buddhism&#x2019;s foundational texts, the Visuddhimagga is a systematic examination and condensation of Buddhist doctrine and meditation technique.

Between them they have five children, six grandchildren, and three Labradors.<b>Chapter 1</b><p>In a broad valley, at the foot of a sloping hillside, beside a clear bubbling stream, Tom was building a house. </p><p>The walls were already three feet high and rising fast. The two masons Tom had engaged were working steadily in the sunshine, their trowels going <i>scrape, slap</i> and then <i>tap, tap</i> while their laborer sweated under the weight of the big stone blocks. Tom&#x2019;s son Alfred was mixing mortar, counting aloud as he scooped sand onto a board. There was also a carpenter, working at the bench beside Tom, carefully shaping a length of beech wood with an adz. </p><p>Alfred was fourteen years old, and tall like Tom. Tom was a head higher than most men, and Alfred was only a couple of inches less, and still growing. They looked alike too: both had light-brown hair and greenish eyes with brown flecks. People said they were a handsome pair. The main difference between them was that Tom had a curly brown beard, whereas Alfred had only a fine blond fluff. The hair on Alfred&#x2019;s head had been that color once, Tom remembered fondly. Now that Alfred was becoming a man, Tom wished he would take a more intelligent interest in his work, for he had a lot to learn if he was to be a mason like his father; but so far Alfred remained bored and baffled by the principles of building. </p><p>When the house was finished it would be the most luxurious home for miles around. The ground floor would be a spacious undercroft, for storage, with a curved vault for a ceiling, so that it would not catch fire. The hall, where people actually lived, would be above, reached by an outside staircase, its height making it hard to attack and easy to defend. Against the hall wall there would be a chimney, to take away the smoke of the fire. This was a radical innovation: Tom had only ever seen one house with a chimney, but it had struck him as such a good idea that he was determined to copy it. At one end of the house, over the hall, there would be a small bedroom, for that was what earls&#x2019; daughters demanded nowadays&#x2014;they were too fine to sleep in the hall with the men and the serving wenches and the hunting dogs. The kitchen would be a separate building, for every kitchen caught fire sooner or later, and there was nothing for it but to build them far away from everything else and put up with lukewarm food. </p><p>Tom was making the doorway of the house. The doorposts would be rounded to look like columns&#x2014;a touch of distinction for the noble newlyweds who were to live here. With his eye on the shaped wooden template he was using as a guide, Tom set his iron chisel obliquely against the stone and tapped it gently with the big wooden hammer. A small shower of fragments fell away from the surface, leaving the shape a little rounder. He did it again. Smooth enough for a cathedral. </p><p>He had worked on a cathedral once&#x2014;Exeter. At first he had treated it like any other job. He had been angry and resentful when the master builder had warned him that his work was not quite up to standard: he knew himself to be rather more careful than the average mason. But then he realized that the walls of a cathedral had to be not just good, but <i>perfect</i>. This was because the cathedral was for God, and also because the building was so <i>big</i> that the slightest lean in the walls, the merest variation from the absolutely true and level, could weaken the structure fatally. Tom&#x2019;s resentment turned to fascination. The combination of a hugely ambitious building with merciless attention to the smallest detail opened Tom&#x2019;s eyes to the wonder of his craft. He learned from the Exeter master about the importance of proportion, the symbolism of various numbers, and the almost magical formulas for working out the correct width of a wall or the angle of a step in a spiral staircase. Such things captivated him. He was surprised to learn that many masons found them incomprehensible. </p><p>After a while Tom had become the master builder&#x2019;s right-hand man, and that was when he began to see the master&#x2019;s shortcomings. The man was a great craftsman and an incompetent organizer. He was completely baffled by the problems of obtaining the right quantity of stone to keep pace with the masons, making sure that the blacksmith made enough of the right tools, burning lime and carting sand for the mortar makers, felling trees for the carpenters, and getting enough money from the cathedral chapter to pay for everything. </p><p>If Tom had stayed at Exeter until the master builder died, he might have become master himself; but the chapter ran out of money&#x2014;partly because of the master&#x2019;s mismanagement&#x2014;and the craftsmen had to move on, looking for work elsewhere. Tom had been offered the post of builder to the Exeter castellan, repairing and improving the city&#x2019;s fortifications. It would have been a lifetime job, barring accidents. But Tom had turned it down, for he wanted to build another cathedral. </p><p>His wife, Agnes, had never understood that decision. They might have had a good stone house, and servants, and their own stables, and meat on the table every dinnertime; and she had never forgiven Tom for turning down the opportunity. She could not comprehend the irresistible attraction of building a cathedral: the absorbing complexity of organization, the intellectual challenge of the calculations, the sheer size of the walls, and the breathtaking beauty and grandeur of the finished building. Once he had tasted that wine, Tom was never satisfied with anything less. </p><p>That had been ten years ago. Since then they had never stayed anywhere for very long. He would design a new chapter house for a monastery, work for a year or two on a castle, or build a town house for a rich merchant; but as soon as he had some money saved he would leave, with his wife and children, and take to the road, looking for another cathedral. </p><p>He glanced up from his bench and saw Agnes standing at the edge of the building site, holding a basket of food in one hand and resting a big jug of beer on the opposite hip. It was midday. He looked at her fondly. No one would ever call her pretty, but her face was full of strength: a broad forehead, large brown eyes, a straight nose, a strong jaw. Her dark, wiry hair was parted in the middle and tied behind. She was Tom&#x2019;s soul mate. </p><p>She poured beer for Tom and Alfred. They stood there for a moment, the two big men and the strong woman, drinking beer from wooden cups; and then the fourth member of the family came skipping out of the wheat field: Martha, seven years old and as pretty as a daffodil, but a daffodil with a petal missing, for she had a gap where two milk teeth had fallen out and the new ones had not yet grown. She ran to Tom, kissed his dusty beard, and begged a sip of his bear. He hugged her bony body. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t drink too much, or you&#x2019;ll fall into a ditch,&#x201d; he said. She staggered around in a circle, pretending to be drunk. </p><p>They all sat down on the woodpile. Agnes handed Tom a hunk of wheat bread, a thick slice of boiled bacon and a small onion. He took a bite from the meat and started to peel the onion. Agnes gave the children food and began to eat her own. Perhaps it was irresponsible, Tom thought, to turn down that dull job in Exeter and go looking for a cathedral to build; but I&#x2019;ve always been able to feed them all, despite my recklessness. </p><p>He took his eating knife from the front pocket of his leather apron, cut a slice off the onion, and ate it with a bite of bread. The onion was sweet and stinging in his mouth. Agnes said: &#x201c;I&#x2019;m with child again.&#x201d; </p><p>Tom stopped chewing and stared at her. A thrill of delight took hold of him. Not knowing what to say, he just smiled foolishly at her. After a few moments she blushed, and said, &#x201c;It isn&#x2019;t <i>that</i> surprising.&#x201d; </p><p>Tom hugged her. &#x201c;Well, well,&#x201d; he said, still grinning with pleasure. &#x201c;A babe to pull my beard. And I thought the next would be Alfred&#x2019;s.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t get too happy yet,&#x201d; Agnes cautioned. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s bad luck to name the child before it&#x2019;s born.&#x201d; </p><p>Tom nodded assent. Agnes had had several miscarriages and one stillborn baby, and there had been another little girl, Matilda, who had lived on two years. &#x201c;I&#x2019;d like a boy, though,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Now that Alfred&#x2019;s so big. When is it due?&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;After Christmas.&#x201d; </p><p>Tom began to calculate. The shell of the house would be finished by first frost, then the stonework would have to be covered with straw to protect it through the winter. The masons would spend the cold months cutting stones for windows, vaults, doorcases and the fireplace, while the carpenter made floorboards and doors and shutters and Tom built the scaffolding for the upstairs work. Then in spring they would vault the undercroft, floor the hall above it, and put on the roof. The job would feed the family until Whitsun, by which time the baby would be a half year old. Then they would move on. &#x201c;Good,&#x201d; he said contentedly. &#x201c;This is good.&#x201d; He ate another slice of onion. </p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m too old to bare children,&#x201d; said Agnes. &#x201c;This must be my last.&#x201d; </p><p>Tom thought about that. He was not sure how old she was, in numbers, but plenty of women bore children at her time in life. However, it was true they suffered more as they grew older, and the babies were not as strong. No doubt she was right. But how would she make certain that she would not conceive again? he wondered. Then he realized how, and a cloud shadowed his sunny mood. </p><p>&#x201c;I may get a good job, in a town,&#x201d; he said, trying to mollify her. &#x201c;A cathedral, or a palace. Then we might have a big house with wood floors, and a maid to help you with the baby.&#x201d; </p><p>Her face hardened, and she said skeptically: &#x201c;It may be.&#x201d; She did not like to hear talk of cathedrals. If Tom had never worked on a cathedral, her face said, she might be living in a town house now, with money saved up and buried under the fireplace, and nothing to worry about. </p><p>Tom looked away and took another bite of bacon. They had something to celebrate, but they were in disharmony. He felt let down. He chewed the tough meat for a while, then he heard a horse. He cocked his head to listen. The rider was coming through the trees from the direction of the road, taking a short cut and avoiding the village. </p><p>A moment later, a young man on a pony trotted up and dismounted. He looked like a squire, a kind of apprentice knight. &#x201c;Your lord is coming,&#x201d; he said. </p><p>Tom stood up. &#x201c;You mean Lord Percy?&#x201d; Percy Hamleigh was one of the most important men in the country. He owned this valley, and many others, and he was paying for the house. </p><p>&#x201c;His son,&#x201d; said the squire. </p><p>&#x201c;Young William.&#x201d; Percy&#x2019;s son, William, was to occupy this house after his marriage. He was engaged to Lady Aliena, the daughter of the earl of Shiring. </p><p>&#x201c;The same,&#x201d; said the squire, &#x201c;And in a rage.&#x201d; </p><p>Tom&#x2019;s heart sank. At the best of times it could be difficult to deal with the owner of a house under construction. An owner in a rage was impossible. &#x201c;What&#x2019;s he angry about?&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;His bride rejected him.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;The earl&#x2019;s daughter?&#x201d; said Tom in surprise. He felt a pang of fear: he had just been thinking how secure his future was. &#x201c;I thought that was settled.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;So did we all&#x2014;except Lady Aliena, it seems,&#x201d; the squire said. &#x201c;The moment she met him, she announced that she wouldn&#x2019;t marry him for all the world and a woodcock.&#x201d; </p><p>Tom frowned worriedly. He did not want this to be true. &#x201c;But the boy&#x2019;s not bad-looking, as I recall.&#x201d; </p><p>Agnes said: &#x201c;As if that made any difference, in her position. If earls&#x2019; daughters were allowed to marry whom they please, we&#x2019;d all be ruled by strolling minstrels and dark-eyed outlaws.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;The girl may yet change her mind,&#x201d; Tom said hopefully. </p><p>&#x201c;She will if her mother takes a birch rod to her,&#x201d; Agnes said. </p><p>The squire said: &#x201c;Her mother&#x2019;s dead.&#x201d; </p><p>Agnes nodded. &#x201c;That explains why she doesn&#x2019;t know the facts of life. But I don&#x2019;t see why her father can&#x2019;t compel her.&#x201d; </p><p>The squire said: &#x201c;It seems he once promised he would never marry her to someone she hated.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;A foolish pledge!&#x201d; Tom said angrily. How could a powerful man tie himself to the whim of a girl in that way? Her marriage could affect military alliances, baronial finances... even the building of this house. </p><p>The squire said: &#x201c;She had a brother, so it&#x2019;s not <i>so</i> important whom she marries.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;Even so...&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;And the earl is an unbending man,&#x201d; the squire went on. &#x201c;He won&#x2019;t go back on a promise, even one made to a child.&#x201d; He shrugged. &#x201c;So they say.&#x201d; </p><p>Tom looked at the low stone walls of the house-to-be. He had not yet saved enough money to keep the family through winter, he realized with a chill. &#x201c;Perhaps the lad will find another bride to share this place with him. He&#x2019;s got the whole county to choose from.&#x201d; </p><p>Alfred spoke in a cracked adolescent voice. &#x201c;By Christ, I think this is him.&#x201d; Following his gaze, they all looked across the field. A horse was coming from the village in a gallop, kicking up a cloud of dust and earth from the pathway. Alfred&#x2019;s oath was prompted by the size as well as the speed of the horse: it was huge. Tom had seen beasts like it before, but perhaps Alfred had not. It was a war-horse, as high at the wither as a man&#x2019;s chin, and broad in proportion. Such war-horses were not bred in England, but came from overseas, and were enormously costly. </p><p>Tom dropped the remains of his bread in the pocket of his apron, then narrowed his eyes against the sun and gazed across the field. The horse had its ears back and nostrils flared, but it seemed to Tom that its head was up, a sign that it was not completely out of control. Sure enough, as it came closer the rider leaned back, hauling on the reins, and the huge animal seemed to slow a little. Now Tom could feel the drumming of its hooves in the ground beneath his feet. He looked around for Martha, thinking to pick her up and put her out of harm&#x2019;s way. Agnes had the same thought. But Martha was not to be seen. </p><p>&#x201c;In the wheat,&#x201d; Agnes said, but Tom had already figured that out and was striding across the site to the edge of the field. He scanned the waving wheat with fear in his heart but he could not see the child. </p><p>The only thing he could think of was to try and slow the horse. He stepped into the path and began to walk toward the charging beast, holding his arms wide. The horse saw him, raised its head for a better look, and slowed perceptibly. Then, to Tom&#x2019;s horror, the rider spurred it on. </p><p>&#x201c;You damned fool!&#x201d; Tom roared, although the rider could not hear. </p><p>That was when Martha stepped out of the field and into the pathway a few yards in front of Tom. </p><p>For an instant Tom stood still in a sick panic. Then he leaped forward, shouting and waving his arms; but this was a war-horse, trained to charge at yelling hordes, and it did not flinch. Martha stood in the middle of the narrow path, staring as if transfixed by the huge beast bearing down on her. There was a moment when Tom realized desperately that he could not get to her before the horse did. He swerved to one side, his arm touching the standing wheat; and at the last instant the horse swerved to the other side. The rise&#x2019;s stirrup brushed Martha&#x2019;s fine hair; a hoof stamped a hole in the ground beside her bare foot; then the horse had gone by, spraying them both with dirt, and Tom snatched her up in his arms and held her tight to his pou...</p></p><h2>Aryadeva&#39;s Four Hundred Stanzas on the Middle Way: With Commentary by Gyel-Tsap (Textual Studies and Translations in Indo-Tibetan Buddhism)</h2><p>Gyel-tsap Dar-ma-rin-chen states that Aryadeva's <i>Four Hundred Stanzas</i> was written to explain how, according to Nagarjuna, the practice of the stages of yogic deeds enables those with Mahayana motivation to attain Buddhahood. Both Nagarjuna and Aryadeva urge those who want to understand reality to induce direct experience of ultimate truth through philosophic inquiry and reasoning. Aryadeva's text is more than a commentary on Nagarjuna's <i>Treatise on the Middle Way</i> because it also explains the extensive paths associated with conventional truths. The <i>Four Hundred Stanzas</i> is one of the fundamental works of Mahayana Buddhist philosophy, and Gyel-tsap's commentary is arguably the most complete and important of the Tibetan commentaries on it. <br><br>Mahayana practitioners must eliminate not only obstructions to liberation but also obstructions to the perfect knowledge of all phenomena. This requires a powerful understanding of selflessness, coupled with a vast accumulation of merit, or positive energy, resulting from the kind of love, compassion, and altruistic intention cultivated by bodhisattvas. The first half of the text focuses on the development of merit by showing how to correct distorted ideas about conventional reality and how to overcome disturbing emotions. The second half explains the nature of ultimate reality that all phenomena are empty of intrinsic existence. Gyel-tsap's commentary on Aryadeva's text takes the form of a lively dialogue that uses the words of Aryadeva to answer hypothetical and actual assertions questions and objections. Geshe Sonam Rinchen has provided additional commentary to the sections on conventional reality, elucidating their relevance for contemporary life. <br><br>This is a republished version of <i>Yogic Deeds of Bodhisattvas</i>.</p><p>Geshe Sonam Rinchen (1933&#x2013;2013) studied at Sera Je Monastery and in 1980 received the Lharampa Geshe degree. He taught Buddhist philosophy and practice at the Library of Tibetan Works and Archives in Dharamsala, India, as well as in dharma centers around the world."A fine and readable translation of an important work of Mahayana Buddhist thought.

D. Schindler's lively art add humor and character to the classic schoolhouse scenes, and readers will love discovering the differences-and similarities- to their own school days.</p><p>Verla Kay is a native Californian who grew up in the sleepy little town of Watsonville. Located right next to the surfing town of Santa Cruz, it nestles between San Francisco and Monterey Bays and enjoys some of the most beautiful scenery and weather in the world. She now resides in the foothills of the Sierra Nevada mountains with her husband, one cat, one bird, and one son.<p>With a crop duster father and a stay-at-home domestic mother, one older sister and one younger brother, Verla's early life seemed ideal - and in many ways it was. But Verla had a hard time making friends and spent most of her younger years as a very lonely child. She spent many hours reading books and daydreaming about friends and love and the happiness that she prayed would someday be hers.</p><p>That happiness came to her when she met her future husband, Terry. It was love at first sight for both of them and after a rocky courtship, they were married on Easter Sunday the spring following their graduation from high school.</p><p>For the first fifteen years, their marriage was anything but ideal, but through sheer stubborness and determination, they made a success of it and their marriage survived despite many loud arguments and frequent broken pottery. During this time, they had four children - three boys and one girl.</p><p>Verla worked off and on, to help make ends meet. But her primary goal was to stay at home and take care of her children, so most of the time the jobs she took were temporary ones and some of them were quite interesting.</p><p>She tried picking chives in the fields, but that job only lasted two weeks. The decision to stay at home and care for her children herself was made very quickly after she discovered that her first paycheck was less than what she owed to her babysitter!</p><p>One of the most fun and profitable jobs Verla ever had was when she worked for a party plan selling toys and gifts at home parties. This was a job that she could do while staying at home with her children and she earned hundreds of free toys and gifts for her family and seven free trips to exotic places around the world on her group sales as a District Manager with this company.</p><p>As a result, she and her husband, Terry, have been to Bogota, Columbia and Rio de Janerio, Brazil in South America. Verla went alone to Israel and both of them toured Portugal in Europe. They enjoyed Hawaii and a cruise to Alaska together. The last trip she earned was to Greece and due to a severe case of bronchitis, she could not go, so she sent Terry without her. He says that cruising the Greek Isles with 600 women while his wife was at home was a wonderful experience - and Verla tends to believe him!</p><p>Becoming A Writer</p><p>It wasn't until Terry and Verla had moved their family to Nevada and purchased a laundromat in Carson City, that she found herself thinking about becoming a writer. One of their regular customers was a woman who was a successful free lance writer for magazines. She looked at some of Verla's writing and was constantly encouraging Verla to become a writer herself. The seed had been sown. They lived in Carson City for three years, then the call of the ocean breezes and tall redwoods became too strong and they moved back to Santa Cruz.</p><p>For the next few years, Verla ran a licensed daycare from her home. Snaps 'N Snails Daycare catered to six children at a time - most of the children being between five months and three years old. While she read books to the children, Verla couldn't stop thinking about writing stories of her own. Finally, the call to WRITE became too strong and she signed up for a correspondence course through the Institute of Children's Literature. During the next two years, she studied and practiced and learned what it took to write and sell stories for children.</p><p>SUCCESS!</p><p>After selling two short stories, one to <i>Turtle Magazine</i> and one to <i>Humpty Dumpty's Magazine</i>, one of her picture book manuscripts was pulled from the slush pile at Putnam Books and she was on her way to being a REAL author. Six months later, Putnam bought a second manuscript.</p><p>It was while Verla was working as a desk clerk in a local motel that she found herself checking in a very special couple one night. While chatting with the people, some things she said about her writing triggered events that eventually led to her gaining a terrific agent in New York who was able to negotiate much better terms for Verla on her third picture book contract.</p><p>Because it wasn't until she was grown that she herself discovered the joys of history, it is Verla's fervent desire to bring history to life for young children in an interesting way. She does this by writing short, entertaining books that spark children's interest in different historical periods. Most of Verla's books are written for young children in a distinctive rhyming style she calls "cryptic rhyme."</p><p>Since April of '97, Verla has been staying home, working full time on her writing. She considers her life to be idyllic. She spends many contented hours in front of her computer screen, thinking, plotting, planning and writing what she hopes will be wonderful books. Her agent has just sold her eighth book. Her first two books (both with Putnam) can be purchased now through any bookstore or by going to Verla's Books page and following the link there to www.Amazon.com.</p><p>Learning and keeping up with the times are very important to Verla and she is constantly discovering new ways to expand her experiences. After building her own website, and putting the #Kidlit children's writer's chat room on her site, she began holding monthly on-line workshops there. Her website has become so popular that Writer's Digest named it one of the Top 101 Websites for Writers in 2000.</p><p>Her first published book, <b>Gold Fever</b>, received three starred reviews and was named a Best Book of the Year by Bank Street College of Education in New York. It is on several public library recommended reading lists.</p><p>Her second book, <b>Iron Horses</b>, received two starred reviews. It has been named a Society of School Librarian's International Honor Book and is also on the Children's Book Council's Notable Social Studies Trade Books for Young People list. Her third book, <b>Covered Wagons, Bumpy Trails</b>, was just released in October of 2000. She has five more picture books to be published in the next few years.</p><p>Today and Beyond</p><p>Most of Verla and Terry's children are grown now, and lead productive lives of their own. Their oldest son, Eric, is the past Senior Network Systems Administrator for Netscape and their middle son, Donn, is currently in his fourth year of college, studying as a vocal music major. Their youngest son, Bruce, is now in his first year of college and is well on his way to becoming a computer programmer. Their only daughter, Portia, is happily married to Heath, and she has given Terry and Verla four incredibly wonderful grandchildren - Kristyn, Charles, Mikayla and Rayana.</p><p>Verla enjoys boating and fishing, reading, writing, and working puzzles. She has spent many happy hours panning for gold with her husband in the nearby hills and she is very proud of a third-place Gold-Panning Competition trophy she won at her county fair in 1994. She is addicted to Nintendo - Dr. Mario is her favorite game. She can repeatedly win level 20 High and once got as far as level 24 on it. She loves computer games and when she is at home and not writing, responding to e-mail or working on her website, she spends many enjoyable hours puzzling her way through her latest adventure program.</p><p>What the future may bring is alw</p></p><h2>20th Century Journey</h2><p>The author of <i>The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich</i> chronicles his life from the years 1904 to 1930, describing the people and places he encountered.</p><p></p><h2>The Magnificent Ambersons (Library of Indiana Classics)</h2><p><p>[FYI: Named one of the 100 Best Novels by the editors of the Modern Library; 7/20/98 New York Times, p.

The protagonist of Booth Tarkington's great historical drama is George Amberson Minafer, the spoiled and arrogant grandson of the founder of the family's magnificence. Eclipsed by a new breed of developers, financiers, and manufacturers, this pampered scion begins his gradual descent from the midwestern aristocracy to the working class. <br>Today The Magnificent Ambersons is best known through the 1942 Orson Welles movie, but as the critic Stanley Kauffmann noted, "It is high time that [the novel] appear again, to stand outside the force of Welles's genius, confident in its own right." <br>"The Magnificent Ambersons is perhaps Tarkington's best novel," judged Van Wyck Brooks. "[It is] a typical story of an American family and town--the great family that locally ruled the roost and vanished virtually in a day as the town spread and darkened into a city. This novel no doubt was a permanent page in the social history of the United States, so admirably conceived and written was the tale of the Ambersons, their house, their fate and the growth of the community in which they were submerged in the end."Booth Tarkington The Magnificent Ambersons is a delightful novel.

From the Voices of the Civil War series, this volume concerns the Battle of Gettysburg. Although the editors address the terrain, the chronology, the main events, and the battle's significance in the context of history, most of the book is devoted to the writing of those who were there as soldiers, nurses, or Gettysburg residents. The result is a series of close-up views showing the human dimension of battle: a portrait photograph and a brief biography precede each letter or diary entry. Other illustrations include photos and sketches of the camps, battlefields, buildings, and surrounding area. A good addition to American history collections.

A good general rule is to spend a lot of time visualizing your goal -- preparing, researching, and experimenting with colors and materials. </p><p>At this planning stage, samples and idea boards are invaluable. Often the simplest techniques and color combinations can convey the most complex ideas. The biggest hurdle for most of us is learning to work confidently -- gaining an understanding of your own intuitive response to color is a great way to become more self-assured. </p><p>It is also very important to consider environmental issues -- you need to find biodegradable materials, and a low-waste technique that will make as little impact on the environment as possible. Most of the projects show the use of freely available multi-purpose tools and equipment. Manufacturers are usually happy to hear your concerns and have begun to offer more choice for the discerning decorator who wishes, for example, to try out water-based products for a project when all traditional examples demonstrate the necessity of oil-based materials. Again, confidence and a willingness to experiment can lead to exciting results. </p><p>It is also important to realize that everyone has their own unique style and there is no definitive, prescribed way to achieve the perfect paint effect. The projects are offered as a starting point for each finish -- to offer you help in accomplishing the particular painting you envisage. The techniques shown are open to endless variation and personal interpretation -- and indeed your own decorative effects can add more individuality, glamor, and surprise as well as being extremely challenging and fun to achieve.

As an accomplished "wheelman" during the late 19th century, Lenz&#x2019;s dreams were dominated by the emerging sport of cycling and an intense desire to make a name for himself. In May of 1892, he attempted to fuse both by embarking on a quest to circumscribe the globe by bicycle. The journey had already been accomplished in tandem, but Lenz upped the ante--and raised eyebrows--by announcing he would ride his dangerous route alone. <i>The Lost Cyclist</i> is a riveting tale of tragedy, pride, and naivete that is both brilliantly told and meticulously researched. Opinions may differ as to whether Lenz was unaware or unconcerned by the inherent dangers he faced, but the story of his fateful journey belongs on the varied shelves of cycling enthusiasts, mystery fans, and nonfiction devotees alike. --<i>Dave Callanan</i> <p></p> <b>Product Description</b><br> In the late 1880s, Frank Lenz of Pittsburgh, a renowned high-wheel racer and long-distance tourist, dreamed of cycling around the world.

Carefully wrapping, drying, and packing a dozen American bialys to ward off translation problems,<br>she set out from New York in search of the people who invented this marvelous bread. Instead, she found a place of utter desolation, where turn-of-the-century massacres, followed by the Holocaust, had reduced the number of Jewish residents from fifty thousand to five.<br><br>Sheraton became a woman with a mission, traveling to Israel, Paris, Austin, Chicago, Buenos Aires, and New York's Lower East Side to rescue the stories of the scattered Bialystokers. In a bittersweet mix of humor and pathos, she tells of their once-vibrant culture and iconic bread, reviving the exiled memories of those who escaped to the corners of the earth with only their recollections--and one very important recipe--to cherish.<br><br>Like Proust's madeleine-inspired reverie, <b>The Bialy Eaters</b> transports readers to a lost world through its bakers' most beloved, and humble, offering. A meaningful gift for any Jewish holiday, this tribute to the human spirit will also have as broad an appeal as the bialy itself, delighting everyone who celebrates the astonishing endurance of the simplest traditions.<br><br>"On a gray and rainy day in November 1992, I stood on Rynek Kosciuszko, the deserted town square of Bialystok, Poland, and was suddenly overcome by the same shadowy sense of loss that I had felt in the old Jewish quarters of Kazimierz in Cracow and Mikulov in Moravia. To anyone who knows their tragic history, these empty streets appear ominously haunting, especially in the somber twilight of a wet, gray afternoon. The damp air seems charged with echoes of silent voices and ghostly wings and the minor-key melodies of fiddlers on rooftops.<br><br>"As a slight chill went through me, I had vague intimations that I was at the beginning of an adventure.

Widely popular in New York City and, to a lesser extent, elsewhere in the</p><p>As many of us know, bialys are chewy, onion-topped rolls, delicious with a cream-cheese schmeer. They originated in Bialystok, Poland, from which they--and the Jews who made and cherished them--have all but disappeared. In <i>The Bialy Eaters</i>, food writer Mimi Sheraton traces the history of this traditional treat and recounts her pursuit of it from Manhattan's Lower East Side (now bialy central) to Bialystok and elsewhere. Her book is principally a tale of the men and women, many pogrom and Holocaust victims, who have lived to recall the once plentiful <i>kuchen</i>. If the story lacks the thrust and imaginative life another writer might have given it, it is still a compelling blend of culinary investigation and poignant cultural evocation. <p> After carefully drying and wrapping exemplary bialys from Kossar's bakery in Manhattan to take with her as memory jogs, Sheraton heads first to Poland. She encounters no true bialy in Bialystok (a hamburger-roll-like bun is proffered in its name), nor does she find one in Israel, Paris, or Argentina. Look-sees in Miami Beach, Florida; Chicago; Scottsdale, Arizona; and Beverly Hills, California, are more encouraging, but also reveal underbaked and undersalted versions made--horror of horrors--with cinnamon sugar, raisins, and blueberries. Her investigation achieves moving resolution, however, in the person of Pesach Szsemunz, an ex-Bialystoker and bialy baker who survived Auschwitz, Dachau, and "other concentration camps" and now lives in Australia. "In 1941," he writes Sheraton, "the Nazis came to us, and since then there are no more Bialystoker kuchen, no more kuchen bakeries, and no more Bialystok Jews. [No other] Bialystoker," he adds, "can tell you more." Yet, as Sheraton reveals in her touching book, bialys do live on, delighting those who eat them--a tribute to endurance itself and the power of everyday life. <i>--Arthur Boehm</i></p>United States, the small, round bialy is characterized by an indented center well that is ringed by a softer, higher rim, all generously flecked with toasted onions and, at its most authentic, with a showering of poppy seeds.

Mattias knew even before he could skate that if he were to harm any of it, if he were to crease one corner of one sheet, the consequences would be serious. But Mattias could not resist his mother&#x2019;s drawing table. He loved the drawers and panels that opened almost without a sound, the bright vials of dye, the immaculate brushes on their small rack, the smooth wooden box of charcoal. And although he was a very obedient boy in almost every other way, he regularly explored the contents of the table when he found himself alone with it. Mattias knew its every measure, including the shape of the black dye stain that had dried inside one drawer before he was born. And each time he approached the table, he expected to find it exactly as he had always found it before.<br>Today he found something new.<br>It was a thick paper envelope, closed but unsealed, underneath his mother&#x2019;s working sketches. Mattias unwound the string closure slowly, being careful to remember the length that should be left hanging when he tied it again. Inside was a square of paper unlike anything Mattias had ever seen. One side of the square glowed with an image in color, almost as if someone had frozen a moment in time and flattened it, capturing every detail. Even his mother, considered the most talented artist now alive, couldn&#x2019;t create anything like this. Mattias turned it carefully in his hands, holding the square by its sharp corners. It was an image of two women. Sisters, he thought. And there was something else&#x2013;a glowing blur behind them.<br>The sun.<br>Seven Years Later<br><br>A headache, Peter thought as he lay in bed with one arm thrown over his eyes, is something you have to experience to understand. No one can describe a headache to someone who has never had one. He rolled to one side and reached for the little spiral notebook on his night table. <br>Peter&#x2019;s mother had gotten headaches for as long as he could remember. They sometimes lasted for days, during which she sat in the red chair next to the pull-out couch where his parents slept. She didn&#x2019;t eat, or laugh, or make the &#x201c;proper supper&#x201d; she otherwise insisted upon. She hardly got up at all. &#x201c;She&#x2019;s gone away again,&#x201d; his father would say. &#x201c;But she&#x2019;ll be back.&#x201d; It happened maybe twice a year. <br>Everyone said how much Peter was like his mother&#x2013; their skin that was nearly paper white, their all-over freckles, their wavy hair (hers dark, his blond like his father&#x2019;s), even the way they sneezed (always twice), and laughed (very quietly, after one loud sort of bark). So Peter had always assumed that, like his mother, he would get headaches one day, and that, when he did, they would be headaches just like hers. <br>Peter paged through the worn notebook. It had his friends&#x2019; phone numbers in it, and the names of some video games he wanted if his parents ever let him <i>get</i> a video game, and the address of a company in Oregon that sold old radio parts for almost no money, and a bunch of other things. He flipped to the inside back cover, where he had made a series of slashes.<br>Just after his twelfth birthday, Peter&#x2019;s mother began asking him whether he had a headache. She had never asked him that before, and he couldn&#x2019;t help thinking it was strange she had to ask at all. Wouldn&#x2019;t it be obvious when he had a headache? Wouldn&#x2019;t he, too, sit in the living room and never smile or get hungry? But she kept asking, every week or two, always smiling carefully, as if she were expecting bad news. So they waited, together. <br>Peter got his first headache a few months later. He knew right away what it was, and three things surprised him about it. First, it lasted only a few hours. Second, although it hurt some, he was able to eat the same salt-and-vinegar potato chips he bought after school every day. Third, he didn&#x2019;t tell his mother about it. <br>The only person he told was Miles. He and Miles had been in the same class every year since kindergarten. They knew everything about each other. For instance, Peter knew that Miles only pretended to hate the two stepsisters who lived uptown with Miles&#x2019;s father and stepmother. The truth was that Miles liked them, and that he liked his Monday and Friday nights at his dad&#x2019;s&#x2013; he liked how the apartment was full of life, with friends coming and going, and teasing at dinner, and the way they always ate oranges and popcorn while they watched TV together.<br>And Miles knew that Peter was afraid to tell his mother about his first headache because it had brought him a little closer to knowing what he had already half-known for years: that his mother&#x2019;s headaches were not headaches at all, but something else entirely. Something she didn&#x2019;t want to talk about. Something like sadness.<br>Then Peter had more headaches. He took the stub of a pencil from where he had wedged it into the spiral of his little notebook and made a mark next to the others. He counted to himself, slowly. His ninth. In a month. He replaced the notebook on the table and rolled over so he could look through the skylight next to his bed.</p><h2>Brooklyn...and How It Got That Way</h2><p>Traces the settlement of the Brooklyn region from early treaties with the Indians to the present</p><p></p><h2>Amber on the Mountain</h2><p>Isolated on her mountain, Amber meets and befriends a girl from the city who gives her the determination to learn to read and write</p><p><b>Tony Johnston</b> grew up in San Marino California.&nbsp;In her "spare time," Johnston has worked at a children's book store, taught a course on picture book writing at UCLA, and studied poetry writing for children with Myra Cohn Livingston. Although she has published nearly seventy-five books, Johnston never stops working. At this moment she is juggling about ten different story ideas. She is grateful for the many ideas that come to her, for the chance to work toward what has become her life goal--to be a good storyteller.Grade 1-3-A story about learning to read and write that doesn't quite work. Amber lives a solitary life high in the mountains. Then one day a man comes with a crew to build a road, bringing along his wife and daughter, Anna. She teaches Amber to read before the road is completed; Amber learns to write on her own so she can keep in touch after Anna's family leaves. The process of mastering these skills, while shown to be a slow one, seems to be one in which, as Anna says, you just, "Set your whole self to the task." Johnston, who has used poetic language to great effect in previous books, seems to be straining to be descriptive here. One brief page of text, for example, is crammed with figurative language, some of which is cliched. She uses expressions that seem to evoke an Appalachian setting, a place where "folks" might "roll clean off" of a road; where people say "hey" to one another. Duncan's large, lush oil paintings unfortunately confuse the issues of time and place. While the frontispiece painting and the details of housing have an Appalachian look, the mountains have the sharp ridges of the Rockies. (The cover painting of the girls on a grassy hillside in front of imposing peaks even evokes strong images of Heidi.) While the setting includes no modern touches, the two children's wardrobes seem to be directly out of the current L.L. Bean catalog. Eve Bunting's The Wednesday Surprise (Clarion, 1989) and Florence Heide's The Day of Ahmed's Secret (Lothrop, 1990) do a better job of telling the literacy story.<br><i>Barbara Chatton, College of Education, University of Wyoming, Laramie</i><br>Copyright 1994 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Difficulties in Mental Prayer</h2><p>Long beloved of Catholics worldwide, this book helps you conquer the obstacles that confront most people when they begin to try to pray regularly.

As a photographer he went to the heart of ugly situations to illustrate the often gruesome realities of life in the city. Weegee&#39;s images scream at their audience. An assault to the eyes was created through his use of the flash&#39;s severe light; the harsh contrasts and deep shadows that resulted gave his images an extra jolt. Concerned more with the impact of his images than with the artistry, Weegee favored a tone of sarcasm and irony with a touch of compassion in his work. This book presents more than 40 images spanning photojournalist Weegee&#39;s career, along with a chronology, exhibition history and selected bibliography.</p><p>Born in Austria in 1899, Arthur H. Fellig, later known as <b>Weegee</b>, became involved in photography shortly after emigrating to the United States with his family in 1910. Weegee gradually established himself as a prolific news photographer and freelanced for many New York newspapers. He also had a brief stint in Hollywood as a technical advisor for several film productions and as an actor.<br><br>Weegee's work has been shown worldwide in exhibitions including <i>Photokina '62</i> in Cologne, West Germany, and at the Museum of Modern Art in 1948 and 1974. In his latter years, he traveled extensively as a lecturer and consultant. Weegee died in New York in 1968.<br>Text: English, French (translation)</p><h2>Three Weeks in Paris</h2><p>Legendary storyteller Barbara Taylor Bradford presents a spellbinding story of four women transformed by old memories and surprising revelations when they meet again at a school reunion in Paris. <br><br>As students at the prestigious Anya Sedgwick School of Decorative Arts in Paris, Alexandra Gordon, Kay Lenox, Jessica Pierce, and Maria Franconi share the challenges and excitement of developing their various artistic talents to the fullest under Sedgwick&#x2019;s caring and demanding guidance. Once best friends, they part enemies, and after graduation go their separate ways, pursuing careers and establishing lives in different corners of the world. Alexandra, a set designer, becomes a leading figure in New York&#x2019;s theater world. Kay, who marries and moves to Scotland, designs a successful line of clothing. Jessica, an interior designer, makes her home in California, while Maria returns to her native Italy, where she continues to work in her family&#x2019;s textile business. <br><br>For each of them, the arrival of an invitation to Paris to celebrate Anya Sedgwick&#x2019;s eighty-fifth birthday stirs up complicated feelings: Nostalgic memories are colored by poignant regrets, and the reluctance to revisit their own pasts mixes with curiosity about their former friends. It is ultimately their desire to deal with unfinished business that convinces all of them to attend the party. During three eventful weeks in Paris, they visit their old haunts, rekindle ties, and awaken in one another the sense of wonder, adventure, and possibilities they had shared so long ago.<br>Barbara Taylor Bradford has long been recognized as one of today&#x2019;s finest chroniclers of women&#x2019;s lives. From her blockbuster debut novel, <i>A Woman</i> <i>of Substance</i>, to her most recent bestseller, <i>The Triumph of Katie Byrne</i>, her books have sold more than 61 million copies worldwide. <i>Three Weeks in Paris</i> is vintage Bradford, filled with the emotional power and captivating plot twists her readers cherish.</p><p><b>BARBARA TAYLOR BRADFORD </b>was born in Leeds, Yorkshire, and was a reporter for the <i>Yorkshire Evening Post</i> at sixteen. By the age of twenty, she had become both an editor and a columnist on London&#x2019;s Fleet Street. In 1979, she wrote her first novel, <i>A Woman of Substance</i>, and that enduring bestseller was followed by sixteen others, most recently <i>The Triumph of Katie Byrne</i>. Ten have been made into television miniseries and movies of the week. Her novels have sold more than 61 million copies in 89 countries and 39 languages worldwide. She lives in New York City with her husband, producer Robert Bradford.CHAPTER ONE<br><br>Alexandra<br><br>It was her favorite time of day. Dusk. That in-between hour before night descended when everything was softly muted, merging together. The twilight hour.<br><br>Her Scottish nanny had called it the gloaming. She loved that name; it conjured up so much, and even when she was a little girl she had looked forward to the late afternoon, that period just before supper. As she had walked home from school with her brother Tim, Nanny between them, tightly holding on to their hands, she had always felt a twinge of excitement, an expectancy, as if something special awaited her. This feeling had never changed. It had stayed with her over the years, and wherever she was in the world, dusk never failed to give her a distinct sense of anticipation.<br><br>She stepped away from her drawing table and went across to the window of her downtown loft, peered out, looking toward the upper reaches of Manhattan. To Alexandra Gordon the sky was absolutely perfect at this precise moment . . . its color a mixture of plum and violet toned down by a hint of smoky gray bleeding into a faded pink. The colors of antiquity, reminiscent of Byzantium and Florence and ancient Greece. And the towers and spires and skyscrapers of this great modern metropolis were blurred, smudged into a sort of timelessness, seemed of no particular period at this moment, inchoate images cast against that almost-violet sky.<br><br>Alexandra smiled to herself. For as far back as she could remember she had believed that this time of day was magical. In the movie business, which she was occasionally a part of these days, dusk was actually called the Magic Hour. Wasn't it odd that she herself had named it that when she was only a child?<br><br>Staring out across the skyline, fragments of her childhood came rushing back to her. For a moment she fell down into her memories . . . memories of the years spent growing up on the Upper East Side of this city . . . of a childhood filled with love and security and the most wondrous of times. Even though their mother had worked, still worked in fact, she and Tim had never been neglected by her, nor by their father. But it was her mother who was the best part of her, and, in more than one sense, she was the product of her mother.<br><br>Lost in remembrances of times past, she eventually roused herself and went back to the drawing board, looking at the panel she had just completed. It was the final one in a series of six, and together they composed a winter landscape in the countryside.<br><br>She knew she had captured most effectively the essence of a cold, snowy evening in the woods, and bending forward, she picked up the panel and carried it to the other side of the studio, placing it on a wide viewing shelf where the rest of the panels were aligned. Staring intently at the now-complete set, she envisioned them as a giant-size backdrop on the stage, which is what they would soon become. As far as she was concerned, the panels were arresting, and depicted exactly what the director had requested.<br><br>"I want to experience the cold, Alexa," Tony Verity had told her at the first production meeting, after he had taken her through the play. "I want to shiver with cold, crunch down into my overcoat, feel the icy night in my bones. Your sets must make me want to rush indoors, to be in front of a roaring fire."<br><br>He will feel all that, she told herself, and stepped back, eyeing her latest work from a distance, her head on one side, thinking of the way she had created the panels in her imagination first. She had envisioned St. Petersburg in winter, and then focused on an imaginary forest beyond that city.<br><br>In her mind's eye, the scenery had come alive, almost like a reel of film playing in her head . . . bare trees glistening with dripping icicles, drifts of new snow sweeping up between the trees like white dunes. White nights. White sky. White moon. White silence.<br><br>That was the mood she sought, had striven for, and wished to convey to the audience. And she believed she had accomplished that with these panels, which would be photographed later that week and then blown up for the stage.<br><br>She had not used any colors except a hint of gray and black for a few of the skeletal branches. Her final touch, and perhaps her most imaginative, had been a set of lone footprints in the snow. Footprints leading up between the trees, as if heading for a special, perhaps even secret, destination. Enigmatic. Mysterious. Even troubling, in a way . . .<br><br>The sharp buzzing of the doorbell brought her head up sharply, and her concentration was instantly broken. She went to the intercom on the wall, lifted the phone. "Hello?"<br><br>"It's Jack. I know I'm early. Can I come up?"<br><br>"Yes, it's okay." She pressed the button that released the street door, and then ran downstairs to the floor below in order to let him in.<br><br>A few seconds later, Jack Wilton, bundled up in a black duffle coat, and carrying a large brown shopping bag, was swinging out of the elevator, walking toward her down the corridor, a grin on his keen, intelligent face.<br><br>"Sorry if I'm mucking up your working day, but I was around the corner. At the Cromer Gallery with Billy Tomkins. It seemed sort of daft to go home and then come back here later. I'll sit in a corner down here and watch CNN until you quit."<br><br>"I just did," she said, laughing. "I've actually finished the last panel."<br><br>"That's great! Congratulations." As he stepped into the small foyer of her apartment, he put down the shopping bag, pulled her into his arms, and pushed the door closed with his booted foot.<br><br>He hugged her tightly, brought her closer, and as his lips brushed her cheek, then nuzzled her ear, she felt a tiny frisson, a shivery feeling. There was an electricity between them that had been missing for ages. She was startled.<br><br>Seemingly, so was he. Jack pulled away, glanced at her quickly, and then instantly brought his mouth to hers, kissing her deeply, passionately. After a second, he moved his mouth close to her ear and murmured, "Let's go and find a bed."<br><br>She leaned back, looking up into his pellucid gray eyes, which were more soulful than ever at that moment. "Don't be silly." As she spoke, a small, tantalizing smile touched her lips and her sparkling eyes were suddenly inviting.<br><br>"Silly? There's nothing silly about going to bed. I think it's a rather serious thing." Throwing his coat on the floor next to the shopping bag and putting his arm around her, he led her into the bedroom.<br><br>He stopped in the middle of the room, and taking hold of her shoulders, turned her to face him, staring into her eyes, his own questioning. "You went missing for a bit," he said, sounding more English than ever.<br><br>She stared back at him, said nothing.<br><br>He tilted her chin, leaned down, and kissed her lightly on the mouth. "But I have the distinct feeling you're suddenly back."<br><br>"I think so."<br><br>"I'm glad, Lexi."<br><br>"So am I," she answered.<br><br>He smiled at her knowingly and led her toward the bed without another word. They sat down together side by side, and he began to unbutton her shirt; she tugged at his tweed jacket, and within seconds they were both undressed, stretched out on the bed.<br><br>Leaning over her, he asked, "And where was it that you went?"<br><br>"Not sure. Fell into a deep pit with my work, I suppose."<br><br>He nodded, fully understanding, since he was an artist and tended to do the same at times when he was painting. But he had really missed her, and her withdrawal, her remoteness, had worried him. Now he brought his mouth down to her, his kisses tender.<br><br>Alexandra felt that frisson once more, and she began to shiver slightly under his touching and kissing, which was becoming provocative. He continued to kiss her as he stroked her thigh, and she experienced a sudden rush of heat, a tingling between her legs.<br><br>Unexpectedly, she stiffened. Swiftly, he brought his mouth to her mouth; his tongue sought hers, slid alongside hers, and they shared a moment of complete intimacy.<br><br>And all the while he did not stop stroking her inner thigh and the center of her womanhood, his fingers working gently but expertly. To him it soon seemed as though she was opening like a lush flower bursting forth under a warm sun.<br><br>When she began to gasp a little, he increased his pressure and speed, wanting her to reach a point of ecstasy. He loved this woman, and he wanted to bind her to him, and he wanted to make love to her now, be joined with her.<br><br>With great speed, he entered her immediately, thrusting into her so forcefully, she cried out. Sliding his hands under her buttocks, he lifted her up, drew her closer to him, calling out her name as he did. "Come to me again, come with me, come where I'm going, Lexi!" he exclaimed, his voice harsh, rasping.<br><br>And so she did as he demanded, wrapped her legs around his back, let her hands rest lightly on his shoulders. Together they soared, and as he began to shudder against her, he told her over and over again how much he loved making love to her.<br><br>Afterward, when they finally lay still, relaxed and depleted, he lifted the duvet up and covered them with it, then took her in his arms. He said against her hair, "Isn't this as good as it gets?"<br><br>When she remained silent, he added, "You know how good we are together . . ."<br><br>"Yes."<br><br>"You're not going to go away from me again, are you?"<br><br>"No . . . it was the work, the pressure."<br><br>"I'm relieved it wasn't me. That you weren't having second thoughts about me."<br><br>She smiled to herself. "You're the best, Jack, the very best. Special . . . unique, actually."<br><br>"Ah, flattery will get you everywhere."<br><br>"I've just been there, haven't I?"<br><br>"Where?"<br><br>"Every...</p><h2>Acts: The Spread of the Gospel (Macarthur Bible Studies)</h2><p>Revised and updated, the MacArthur Study Guide Series takes the participant on a journey through the Bible, book by book.

She lives near Dublin, Ireland.</p>CHAPTER ONE <br>&nbsp; <br>&nbsp; <br>Dark. <br>The moon is dark; the stars are smothered by clouds. Autumn is upon us now. This morning the rain rushed down the hills like silver snakes, yet nothing is moving tonight. Even the mice and moles cower in their burrows. The earth holds her breath as if waiting for disaster, but the disaster has already happened. <br>Civilization has collapsed. <br>Lucius Plautius, who studied with the Athenians, would say I am suffering from depression. He could be right. <br>Dinas, who laughs at everything, would say there is no such thing as depression. He could be right. <br>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* <br>Cadogan leaned his shoulder against the door, braced his feet and shoved again. Nothing happened. The oak planks did not even creak. <br>The door was like the woman on the other side. Obdurate. The woman who had slid the bolt across the door. There was no other way in. The walls were constructed of solid logs. The few windows provided ventilation and a modicum of light, but they were too narrow to admit an intruder. In cold weather they were shuttered with two planks. <br>Cadogan stepped away from the door and rubbed his shoulder. He was weary to the bone. He had been riding for most of the night. Alternately trotting and cantering through the haunted darkness, up and down hills, splashing through streams, dodging trees at the last moment only to be slashed by low hanging branches. Trusting his horse to take him home. <br>To sanctuary. <br>In years gone by a traveler might have found a comfortable inn along the way. In such an establishment Cadogan would have enjoyed an ample meal and a flagon of the local brew while the hosteler rubbed down the bay mare and gave her a heaping measure of oats. A few coins more would have purchased a dry bed for himself&#x2014;with a minimum of fleas&#x2014;so he could resume his journey in the morning feeling refreshed. <br>There were no comfortable inns anymore. No lantern&#x2019;s gleam to welcome weary travelers. Windows were shuttered if any shutters remained. Doors sagged from rusting hinges; arrogant weeds thrust through floorboards. Business was very bad indeed. <br>The bay mare would have no oats tonight. Cadogan had removed her saddle and bridle and turned her loose to graze, knowing she would not wander far. She was too old and too wise to stray. This was the only home she had known for two years and she was content. <br>He could hear her tearing up mouthfuls of dry grass. <br>Cadogan stopped rubbing his shoulder and stood deep in thought. Then he walked around to the rear of the building, where he had stacked a quantity of firewood along the north wall. Heavy branches had been chopped into neat lengths, ready for burning. Kindling was wedged between the logs and the wall to create an added layer of insulation. Cadogan reached in and pulled out a handful of sturdy twigs. Ignoring the protestations of his aching body, he crouched and set them on the ground. Quietly. <br>His night-adapted eyes could make out general shapes but no specifics. Still crouching, he ran his hands over the nearby earth until he found several thick clumps of grass. Dying grass left from summer. He ripped them up, roots and all, and carried them with the kindling to the west side of the building. The side nearest the forest. A single narrow window was set in the wall. <br>Cadogan turned his back on the window and took two measured paces forward. He rolled the clumps of grass together until they formed a loose ball, which he placed on the ground before him. Loosening his linen underpants, he dribbled a few drops of urine onto the grass, just enough to dampen the center while leaving some dry tips. He used the twigs to fashion inward-leaning walls around the grass to hold it in place. Next he took a set of flints from the leather pouch on his belt and began striking sparks over his construction. After several tries, the dry grass tips ignited in a sizzle of red and gold. <br>Cadogan crouched and blew gently on the blades to keep them burning, then sat back on his heels and waited. <br>Although light was visible through the window, he did not call out to the woman inside. Not again. After taking care of his horse he had hammered his fist on the door. Called out his name. Expected her to welcome him. Instead she had bolted the door before he could push it open and enter. <br>Obviously another method of communication was required. <br>The smoke began to seep out of its enclosure like a timid creature poking its nose out of a burrow. Cadogan waited until it formed a pale cloud, dimly lit from beneath. The small ball of grass was too damp to fuel a substantial fire, but perfect for making smoke. He leaned forward and blew again. Sat back with eyes narrowed, calculating the exact moment when a final, well-placed breath would send the cloud upward. <br>When the column of smoke had thickened sufficiently he stood up and unfastened his hooded cloak. Waving it in front of him, he began wafting the smoke toward the window. <br>Some distance away, the mare raised her head and snorted. <br>A nightingale called among the trees, immediately answered by another. Even in the dark territories must be defined and boundaries respected. Nature&#x2019;s laws were strict. <br>Cadogan moved back and forth, almost dancing on the balls of his feet as he directed and redirected the smoke. Even something as diaphanous as smoke could be controlled with persistence. <br>The woman inside called out, &#x201c;Are you still there?&#x201d; Her voice was unpleasantly sharp, with an edge like a knife. It was almost the only thing he remembered about her. <br>He continued shepherding smoke. <br>&#x201c;Is that you, Cadogan? What are you doing?&#x201d; <br>Weave and twist, draw patterns in the air. Try to ignore the sudden stitch in his side. <br>&#x201c;Cadogan! You said I could stay here. You said!&#x201d; Her voice shrilled upward. She could smell the smoke now. In summer the lightning, the random finger of God, set trees ablaze to renew them. And the trees were very near. <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m in here, Cadogan!&#x201d; she cried. &#x201c;Answer me!&#x201d; <br>He flung his cloak over his shoulder like a toga and walked around to the front of the building. Flattening himself against the wall beside the door, he waited. <br>He heard her groan as she lifted the heavy bolt and set it aside. The iron hinges, which he never greased, protested loudly when she pulled the door open. She thrust her head into the night. It was too dark to see anything. Holding her breath, she listened for the crackling of fire. Was it coming nearer? What should she do? <br>She ducked back inside. Looked wildly about the room. <br>The smell of smoke was growing stronger. <br>When she ran through the open doorway Cadogan lunged forward and caught her. He could feel how thin she was beneath her gown. All angles, with no comfort in her body to offer a man. Strong, though; she fought like one of the savage wildcats from Caledonia. Screeching, squalling, writhing in his grip and trying to scratch his eyes out. <br>A plague on the wretched woman! thought Cadogan. He immediately repented, reminding himself that he was a Christian. But even Christ had lost his temper with the money changers. <br>By the time Cadogan managed to pinion her wrists they were both panting. <br>&#x201c;You said I could stay, you said I could stay!&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Only until my cousin came back for you,&#x201d; Cadogan replied. He had been told his deep voice was &#x201c;reassuring,&#x201d; but his next words were anything but reassuring. &#x201c;If Dinas hasn&#x2019;t come for you by now he&#x2019;s not going to.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;You don&#x2019;t know that!&#x201d; she shrilled. <br>&#x201c;I know him. You&#x2019;re not the first woman he&#x2019;s abandoned.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;He hasn&#x2019;t abandoned me, he never would! Dinas adores me. Many men have said they loved me, but none are as passionate as Dinas. He swore he&#x2019;d throw himself on his sword if he ever lost me!&#x201d; <br>Cadogan began to feel sorry for her. And sorry for himself, for his aching body and leaden weariness. Sorry that his life&#x2014;which only a month ago had been filled with a hermit&#x2019;s simple pleasures&#x2014;was being torn asunder through no fault of his own. <br>&#x201c;You should go inside now,&#x201d; he said, releasing her wrists. <br>&#x201c;But there&#x2019;s a fire coming!&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t worry, you&#x2019;ll be safe. There&#x2019;s no real fire, only damp grass smoking.&#x201d; <br>She caught her breath. &#x201c;Do you mean&nbsp;&#x2026; did you trick me?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;I had to make you open the door.&#x201d; <br>She furiously pummeled his chest with her fists. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re a terrible man and I hate you! Hate you, hate you, hate you!&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s too bad.&#x201d; He captured her wrists again and started to force her into the house. Thought better of it. Pulling her after him, he went around to the back of the building. <br>She made no effort to free herself. Instead she kept up a running commentary on his failures as a human being while he stamped on the fire. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re worthless compared to your cousin, do you know that? Dinas is a twelve-pronged stag and you&#x2019;re a pile of goat dung. Goat dung with flies on it!&#x201d; <br>Cadogan noticed that she had begun drawling her vowels. &#x201c;Dinas is twice the man you are, he has balls like melons and a prick like a stallion. What do you have under your tunic, a dead eel? The first time I saw you I knew you were nothing. If Dinas was here you couldn&#x2019;t treat me like this, because he would knock your teeth out.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Dinas likes to fight,&#x201d; Cadogan said. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;So you&#x2019;re a coward as well.&#x201d; <br>He ignored the insult and continued extinguishing the fire. It took a while to hunt down and crush the last tiny spark. When he was satisfied there no danger of the blaze flaring up again, he took her back inside. Still yammering at him. Her voice was seriously beginning to grate on his nerves. <br>A bronze oil lamp on a three-legged table supplied the only light. The draft from the closing door caused the flame to gutter, flickering as if it might go out. Cadogan released the woman so he could slide the heavy bolt across the door, then he took a large tin ewer from beneath the table. When he lifted it his heart sank. He thumbed back the lid and peered inside anyway. The ewer was empty. She had burned all the herring oil. <br>&#x201c;There isn&#x2019;t any more,&#x201d; she confirmed. &#x201c;I already looked.&#x201d; <br>He turned to find her sitting on the bed. The only bed. <br>&#x201c;Why did you have to burn all of it?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;What did you expect me to do, sit in the dark? You&#x2019;re not much of a host, Cadogan. In fact I don&#x2019;t like anything about you. Not your splotchy face, not your flabby body, not even your feet. You&#x2019;re the ugliest creature I&#x2019;ve ever seen.&#x201d; <br>The man to whom she spoke was above average height, with a sturdy body sculpted by hard work. He had a clean shaven, affable face that still retained a smattering of boyish freckles, and wore his thick brown hair cropped in the Roman style. <br>Puzzled, Cadogan asked, &#x201c;What&#x2019;s wrong with my feet?&#x201d; <br>She did not answer. <br>He rubbed his shoulder again. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m tired; I&#x2019;m very tired. I&#x2019;ve had several bad days and I need some sleep, so I&#x2019;m afraid you&#x2019;ll have to sit somewhere else.&#x201d; <br>She raised a pair of overplucked eyebrows. &#x201c;Why should I perch on a stool when there&#x2019;s a comfortable bed? Dinas never told me you were brutal, Cadogan. He said you were kind. He said I could rely on your kindness.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Dinas says too thundering much and none of it true,&#x201d; Cadogan growled. Taking her by the elbows, he moved her off the bed. She hung like dead weight in his hands. When he released her she flounced over to a stool and sat down. &#x201c;I hate you,&#x201d; she said flatly. &#x201c;I always have and I always will.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;You don&#x2019;t even know me.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;That makes it easier.&#x201d; <br>Cadogan stretched out on the bed and folded his arms behind his head. It was easier to ignore her than have a conversation with her. His eyes wandered around the room. As always, his handiwork gave him a sense of satisfaction in spite of his somber mood. <br>Seen from outside, his home was unimpressive. A rectangular timber building with a steeply pitched roof, it melted into its forest setting. To the casual observer it might have been a woodcutter&#x2019;s cabin, though it was too large for one. It more nearly resembled a small fort. <br>A fortlet. <br>That had not been his original intention. During construction the house had seemed to choose its own shape. By the time it was finished he realized what he had wanted all along was a fort. A building sufficient to protect its occupant from the intrusions and abrasions of the outside world. <br>His first choice for the exterior walls was stone and mortar, his second choice was brick. Stone was impossible for one man to quarry and transport, and the nearest brickyard was many miles away. That left only the raw materials at hand. Cadogan had felled the trees and sawn the wood himself, learning the necessary skills as he went along. Trial and error. Axe and adze and plane. Use the mare to drag the heavy logs into place. Laboriously raise them one by one, chink the gaps with mud. For two years he had pushed his body to its limits, promising himself he would correct his mistakes later. When there was time. <br>The interior of the building showed a certain refinement. It consisted of one large room whose unpeeled log walls were covered by smooth planks. The roof was supported by tree trunks shaped into columns. The clay floor had been pounded until it gleamed, then incised with patterns imitating mosaic tiles. In the center of the room was a raised stone hearth surmounted by andirons decorated with boars&#x2019; heads. Above this was a smoke hole, cleverly concealed within the angle of the roof. <br>One end of the room was given over to storage. Crates and bags and boxes of various sizes were neatly stacked beside an assortment of tools, some of them handmade, all of them well maintained. Cadogan&#x2019;s clothing was hung on pegs. Hunting spears leaned against the wall with their feet ensnared in fishing nets. A large iron cauldron complete with flesh hooks was stored beneath a row of shelves. The bottom shelf was crammed with tin cooking utensils and everyday plates and cups cast in pewter. The shelf above this boasted a complete set of glazed red tableware, plus a single, exquisite glass bottle the color of emeralds. The top shelf was fitted with cubbyholes designed to hold Cadogan&#x2019;s cherished collection of manuscripts. Scrolls of Athenian poetry, Alexandrian maps, books of Latin history and theology. The books had been written on thin sheets formed by pounding together crisscross slices of the pith of a sedge called papyrus. <br>At the opposite end of the room was a wooden bedstead, held high off the floor by oak stumps. The bed was equipped with a horsehair mattress, a rather grimy sleeping pad stuffed with goose down, an equally grimy linen sheet and three woolen blankets. Near the bed a naturally formed stone basin was set atop another broad stump. Cadogan had found the object in the river the preceding autumn, when the water was low enough to allow for easy fording. Over many centuries the river had shaped and polished the stones in its bed as it slowly changed its course. Following the way of least resistance. <br>The remainder of Cadogan&#x2019;s furniture consisted of a brass-bound chest inlaid with silver and copper, two brightly painted wooden stools, a battered campaign table with folding legs, and a larger oak table. The lamp on that table had been one of his mother&#x2019;s treasures. When he was a child she had guided his chubby fingers around the swirling acanthus leaves engraved on the bronze surface. &#x201c;See how beautiful, Cadogan?&#x201d; He had loved beauty ever since. <br>The woman followed the direction of his eyes. Where he saw achievement she saw failure. Crude construction and a dirt floor covered with chicken scratches. Most of the furniture looked as if it had been hacked out with an axe.

No one could have guessed that the town was hovering on the brink of tragedy. Well, I suppose that&#x201d;s not technically true. The Sphinx might have known, and the Norns, too, come to think of it. But if they did, they kept it to themselves.</p><p>There&#x201d;s some sort of Soothsayers&#x201d; Code that prevents soothsayers from soothsaying on a day-to-day basis, when it might, you know, avert this kind of ordinary, everyday tragedy. Something about the laws of causality being broken and the order of creation overturned, resulting in a world run amok, rivers running backward, the sun rising in the west, cats and dogs getting married. . . .</p><p>I don&#x201d;t know; don&#x201d;t ask me.</p><p>I don&#x201d;t pretend to understand, especially since it wasn&#x201d;t an ordinary, everyday tragedy after all. But I guess it didn&#x201d;t rise to the standard required to break the Soothsayers&#x201d; Code, since no sooth was said.</p><p>Anyway, I&#x201d;m getting ahead of myself.</p><p>So, it was an idyllic evening in Pemkowet, the little resort town I call home. A mid-July Michigan evening, soft and warm, not too muggy, one of those evenings when the sunlight promises to linger forever.</p><p>It was a Sunday, and I had plans to meet my best friend, Jen Cassopolis, for Music in the Gazebo. Los Gatos del Sol, a Tex-Mex band, were playing. They say music hath charms to soothe the savage breast, and in my experience, it&#x201d;s true. Also, I&#x201d;d seen the promo poster, and the guys in the band were pretty cute.</p><p>Hey, it doesn&#x201d;t hurt.</p><p>Mogwai didn&#x201d;t come when I called him, but he was a cat of independent means and he&#x201d;d been pissed at me since I&#x201d;d given in to pleas from my friends in animal rescue and had him neutered. I&#x201d;d hated to do it, since he wasn&#x201d;t really my cat so much as a streetwise buddy who dropped by on a regular basis, but there were an awful lot of feral Moglets running around town. I filled his bowl on the back porch and made sure the torn screen that served as a cat door was ajar.</p><p>It wasn&#x201d;t the most secure arrangement, but I didn&#x201d;t worry too much. For one thing, my apartment was on the second story above Mrs. Browne&#x201d;s Olde World Bakery. Mogwai&#x201d;s route to the screened porch involved a series of feline acrobatics, Dumpster to fence to porch, that I doubted many humans could duplicate.</p><p>As for nonhumans . . . well. Those who were my friends, I trusted. As far as I knew, those who weren&#x201d;t didn&#x201d;t want much of anything to do with me.</p><p>I slung my folding chair in the carrying case over my shoulder, locked the apartment behind me, and headed down the stairs into the alley alongside the park. In front of the bakery, there was a line of tourists spilling out the door and down the sidewalk. There always was at this time of year. Most locals would avoid the place until after Labor Day.</p><p>It was quiet in the rear of the bakery. That was where the magic happened, but it happened in the wee hours of the night, after the bars had closed and the last tourist had staggered home, before the sun rose.</p><p>Cutting through the park, I headed for the river, dodging meandering families pushing strollers, small children clutching ice-cream cones that melted and dripped down their chubby hands.</p><p>It could be a pain if you were in a hurry, but I wasn&#x201d;t, so it made me smile. I still remembered my first ice-cream cone. It was Blue Moon, a single scoop in a kiddie cone. If you&#x201d;ve never had it, I can&#x201d;t even begin to describe it.</p><p>Truth is, for all its quirks and flaws, I love this town. I wasn&#x201d;t born here, but I was conceived here. And when my mom returned here four years later, a desperate young single mother with a half-human child who couldn&#x201d;t manage to fit into the mundane world outside, Pemkowet took us in.</p><p>Twenty years later, I&#x201d;m still glad to be here.</p><p>My feeling of benevolent well-being persisted the entire two blocks it took to reach the gazebo. The gazebo was perched in a smaller park alongside the river. It was a fanciful structure of white gingerbread wicker strung with white Christmas lights, dim in the still-bright daylight. The band was setting up, and a good-size crowd had already gathered, locals and tourists alike. The river sparkled in the sunlight. It had its own unique smell, dank and green and a little fishy, yet somehow appealing.</p><p>The hand-cranked chain ferry, its curlicued canopy also painted white, was making its way across the river, the big chain rattling as a pair of small boys hauled furiously at the crank, their efforts encouraged by the amused operator in the best Tom Sawyer tradition. I&#x201d;d begged for a chance to turn the crank when I was a kid, too. Beside the ferry landing, a massive weeping willow trailed an abundance of graceful branches into the water. Beneath its green shadow, tourists fed popcorn to the ducks, the adults hoping for a glimpse of something more eldritch and exotic, the children delighted to settle for greedy mallards.</p><p>Life was good.</p><p>A vast affection filled me, making me feel warm and buoyant. I held on to the feeling, willing it to last.</p><p>It didn&#x201d;t.</p><p>The moment I caught sight of Jen, it fled, leaving me feeling as shriveled as a pricked balloon. Envy rushed in to fill the empty space it left behind.</p><p>I&#x201d;m okay with being cute, honest. I shouldn&#x201d;t complain. I recognize the fact that there&#x201d;s a certain irony in it. On a good day, I can aspire to pretty.</p><p>Jen&#x201d;s pretty on an ordinary day, and on a good day, she can aspire to gorgeous. She&#x201d;s got that perfect Mediterranean coloring, with dark hair and olive skin, and she&#x201d;s one of those girls who always looks sort of glossy. When we were both teenagers, my mom said she looked like Phoebe Cates in <i>Fast Times at Ridgemont High</i>. I&#x201d;d never heard of the movie, which shocked Mom, so she rented it from the library and we watched it together. We watched a lot of TV and videos together, Mom and I. Turns out it was a pretty good movie, and she was right.</p><p>Anyway.</p><p>Jen was having a good day, in part because the light was hitting her just so, and in part because she was flirting with a guy who obviously found her attractive, mirroring it right back at him. A guy I knew.</p><p>Oh, crap.</p><p>In a small town, practically everyone knows one another. When you combine the entire population of Pemkowet, East Pemkowet, and the outlying township, it&#x201d;s only about three thousand people. Between the tourists, the cottagers, and the boat owners, that triples during the summer, but they don&#x201d;t count in the same way people you went to high school with do.</p><p>I not only went to high school with Cody Fairfax, I worked with him at the Pemkowet Police Department, where he was the youngest patrol officer on the force and I was a part-time file clerk. Or at least that&#x201d;s what I&#x201d;d started out as. I did a lot more behind the scenes, but that was mostly between me and the chief.</p><p>Unfortunately for me, I had a whopper of an unrequited crush on Cody Fairfax, who was currently lounging on a blanket at my best friend&#x201d;s feet, propped on his elbows, legs crossed at the ankles. Unfortunately for him, I also knew exactly what kind of closet case he was. When it came to women, he had a reputation for being a player that he&#x201d;d earned fair and square, but there was a reason behind it, and it wasn&#x201d;t fear of commitment.</p><p>Cody was afraid of being found out.</p><p>Envy and anger, two of the Seven Deadlies. I could feel them coiling deliciously in my gut, wanting to rise and consume me. I had to be careful with that sort of thing, especially anger. When I lost control of my temper, things . . . happened. With an effort, I made myself envision the emotions as a glass filled with roiling liquid, and imagined myself emptying it slowly on the ground.</p><p>Bit by bit, my mood eased.</p><p>While the band tuned their instruments, I picked my way through the throng, unpacked my folding chair, and plunked it beside Jen&#x201d;s.</p><p>She glanced over at me. &#x201c;Hey, Daise! It&#x201d;s about time.&#x201d;</p><p>I made myself smile in response. &#x201c;Yeah, sorry. I was hoping Mogwai had forgiven me.&#x201d;</p><p>Jen laughed. &#x201c;After you had him snipped? Not likely.&#x201d;</p><p>Cody acknowledged me with a studied casualness. &#x201c;Good evening, Miss Daisy Jo.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Officer Fairfax.&#x201d; I shot him a covert glare. He raised one eyebrow in response.</p><p>Members of the eldritch always recognize one another, and we can usually identify one another by nature or species in time. Cody knew perfectly well that I knew what he was. After all, in some circles in Pemkowet, it was common knowledge. But the soothsayers aren&#x201d;t the only ones with a code. There&#x201d;s a code of honor in the eldritch community, too. You don&#x201d;t out one another. Everyone in town knew about me because the story had gotten around when I was conceived, even before Mom and I moved back here. It was different with the Fairfaxes. And I wouldn&#x201d;t out Cody for spite or any other petty reason. I&#x201d;d catch some serious flak if I did, and his reclusive clan was rumored to be pretty dangerous, too. But that didn&#x201d;t mean I was about to let him work his wiles on Jen. She&#x201d;d had a hard enough life.</p><p>I just wished he weren&#x201d;t so damn good-looking and that I didn&#x201d;t have a crush on him.</p><p>I couldn&#x201d;t help it. For me, it went back to the fourth grade. Cody was in the seventh grade, and we rode the school bus together: me to the mobile home community alongside the river out in the marshy sticks where Mom rented the double-wide she owns now, him to his clan&#x201d;s place out in the county woods.</p><p>There were bullies on the bus, and if I wasn&#x201d;t exactly afraid of them, I was afraid of the reaction they might elicit from me. They had heard the rumors. They made it a point to pick on me.</p><p>Cody made them quit.</p><p>It was as simple as that, and I&#x201d;d been infatuated with him ever since. Even through his transformation from a promising young JV basketball star to a semidropout loser and alleged stoner, through his myriad high-school-and-after conquests, none of which ever lasted longer than a month or two, and through his surprising rebirth as an officer of the law.</p><p>Once, he had protected me.</p><p>It was enough.</p><p>&#x201c;Ladies, I should be going.&#x201d; Uncrossing his legs and hoisting himself from propped elbows, Cody rose to his feet. He did it in one effortless movement, the kind you might expect of someone who had been a JV basketball star. Or, say, a feral someone who occasionally howled at the moon and turned into something wild, untamed, and bloodthirsty, possibly quite furry. &#x201c;I&#x201d;m on duty tonight.&#x201d;</p><p>I glanced surreptitiously at the sky, where a crescent moon hung pale in the fading cerulean. The chief and I had never discussed it, but I was pretty sure he scheduled Cody for patrol duty very, very carefully.</p><p>&#x201c;Call me?&#x201d; Jen asked hopefully.</p><p>Cody&#x201d;s gaze slide sideways toward me. He had light brown eyes speckled with gold, a distinctive topaz color. There was a hint of phosphorescent green behind them that only I could see. &#x201c;We&#x201d;ll see.&#x201d;</p><p>He left, and the locals in attendance retrieved various prohibited adult beverages they&#x201d;d hidden from his view.</p><p>&#x201c;Jeez!&#x201d; Jen muttered under her breath. &#x201c;Call or don&#x201d;t call, but you don&#x201d;t have to be a jerk about it.&#x201d; She paused. &#x201c;Do you think he&#x201d;ll call?&#x201d;</p><p>I shrugged. &#x201c;I guess we&#x201d;ll see.&#x201d;</p></p><h2>Love and Sleep</h2><p>A visionary novel written in the tradition of magical realism by the author of Little, Big explores the mysteries of childhood, parenthood, love, death, and the universe. Reprint.</p><p>"From John Crowley, author of <i>Little, Big</i>, comes a major work of American magic realism set in the same realm of infinite possibility as his critically acclaimed <i>Egypt (a New York Times</i> "notable Book" for 1987). <i>Love</i> &amp; <i>Sleep</i> revolves around Pierce Moffett, who as a boy was no stranger to magic, scratching the surface of ordinary life to find something glittering and strange underneath. For most children, these revelations fade with time, but for the adult Pierce -- struggling to retain the youthful vision and innocence of childhood -- the search for the hidden history of the world is just beginning. An eloquent treatise on the secrets of life, <i>Love</i> &amp; <i>Sleep</i> proves Crowley to be one of American literature's most original and valuable treasures. <p> "John Crowley is an abundantly gifted writer, a scholar whose passion for history is matched by his ability to write a graceful sentence." -- <i>New York Times Book Review</i>. </p><p> "Crowley is generous, obsessed, fascinating, gripping. Really, I think Crowley is so good that he has left everybody else in the dust." -- <i>Peter Straub</i> </p><p> "A master of language, plot and characterization, Crowley triumphs in this occult and Herrnetic tale, at once naturalistically persuasive and uncannily visionary. <i>Love &amp; Sleep</i> rewards endless rereading, as does <i>Little, Big</i>." -- Harold Bloom, author of <i>The Book Of J.</i></p>Crowley (Aegypt, 1987, etc.) struggles to recapture the smooth blending of straight narrative and speculative hermeticism that gave his best work, Little, Big (1981), the startling quality of metaphysical realism. It eludes him, unfortunately, here. Very much a book of levels, as the title's two primal forces indicate, this is the story of a writer named Pierce Moffett, who grew up with his mother and uncle and cousins in rural Kentucky (far removed from his homosexual father back in New York City). Pierce eventually turns into an upstate New York loner, an isolato equipped with paranormal gifts of magic and wisdom that set him more firmly in tune with the music of the spheres than with the lives of his neighbors. The book is a chronicle of Pierce's slow steps into this world (a fuller sex life, learning to drive) but also a charting of the introduction he unwittingly provides to others of a reality off, as it were, to one side of daily conscious life. Crowley adds historical focus in chapters about the struggles of two 16th-century psychic pioneers, the Italian metaphysician Giordano Bruno and the English mage John Dee. These historical sections, though graceful (Crowley is a deliciously elegant writer, sentence by sentence), are heavy dumplings; and though Crowley ultimately and quite strikingly turnbuckles the two levels into one at the end, it feels a lot less than natural and inevitable. The split-vision pretty much weighs down the spring of Pierce's pilgrim's progress into love and eroticism (women, but also a sexual relationship with a 13-year-old boy who is his illegitimate son, a pure Eros figure). In the end, the secret knowledge so sought after here comes to seem a burden the reader would rather shrug off than embrace. Disappointing. -- <i>Copyright �1994, Kirkus Associates, LP.

The illustrations are the real draw here-large, vivid, and expertly composed. The historical context of the original voyage is briefly sketched, as is the journey itself. Short chapters chronicle the provisioning of a ship from that time and describe navigation techniques. The readable text gives a good idea of the many unpleasant aspects of shipboard life in 1620, but doesn't present information that isn't available in many other books. The authors state that the settlers had "little or no respect" for Native Americans. Regarding the seed corn and other items that the exploratory parties took from the Native villages, the comment is that "few- considered this stealing." No mention is made of William Bradford's journal note that the goods would be paid for when the owners could be identified, and that this was done the following spring. Susan Whitehurst's lavishly illustrated The Mayflower (PowerKids, 2003) is briefer. Kate Waters's On the Mayflower: Voyage of the Ship's Apprentice and a Passenger Girl (Scholastic, 1996) is also illustrated with color photographs of interpreters aboard the Mayflower II, but fictionalizes events. Ann McGovern's -If You Sailed on the Mayflower in 1620 (Scholastic, 1991) looks drab by comparison, but contains more information.

One of the world&#x2019;s leading military historians, Lloyd Clark, delivers a gripping narrative and fresh interpretation of this remarkable but overshadowed battle. About six months before D-Day, in January 1944, a united force of 36,000 soldiers launched one of the first attacks on continental Europe at Anzio, a small coastal city thirty miles south of Rome. But the advance stalled, and the Allies were unable to exploit initial German weakness that could have led to a decisive strike to liberate the undefended Italian capital. As the Germans gained strength, their force growing to 120,000 men, Anzio beach became a death trap. With winter beating down, the Allies held on, pushing more men, guns, and armor into the stalemate, though their men were still sorely outnumbered. After five months of fighting, and monumental casualties on both sides, the Allies were able to successfully crack the German line, capturing Rome on June 4, just two days before D-Day.</p><p>After victories in North Africa and Sicily, the Allies invaded Italy in September 1943 and quickly bogged down, as German commander Kesselring fought a brilliant defensive campaign aided by miserable weather and primitive, mountainous terrain. To break the stalemate in January 1944, two Allied divisions landed behind German lines at Anzio, encountering surprisingly little resistance. Within days, German units rushed to the small beachhead for some of the most concentrated, brutal, bloody fighting outside the Russian front. British historian Clark delivers an absorbing account of the terrible battle. Historians criticize the force's commander, Gen. John Lucas, for not pushing inland to cut off the Germans or even capture Rome, though Lucas insisted he had too few men. Clark agrees, but adds that Lucas should have advanced far enough to occupy a stronger defensive position. By February, the Allies had secured the beachhead and the energetic Lucian Truscott took over from Lucas, but it was not until May that troops broke out. Clark does not rock any historical boats, but he tells a relentlessly fascinating story with plenty of asides about individuals' experiences. Carlo D'Este's 1991 history may still be the best on the subject, but no reader will be disappointed with Clark's. <i>(Nov.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.For the Allies in World War II, the fighting in Italy was miserable, frustrating, and, to critics, strategically questionable. Clark, a perceptive and empathic historian posted at Britain's military academy, concentrates on an episode that embodied the problems of the Italian campaign: the landing at Anzio near Rome in January 1944. Clark describes the Allies' disagreement at the top levels over the wisdom of the operation. American strategists disliked it as a logistical drain on the imminent cross-channel attack; its British advocates thought an Anzio coup would unhinge the German military in Italy. Clark then lets the battle unfold: the landing, quickly immobilized by the German army, degenerates into a five-month battle of attrition. While riflemen die by the thousands, a harrowing decimation Clark evokes in grim excerpts from survivors, battlefield commander John Lucas seems unable to control the situation and becomes the official scapegoat for Anzio's failure. Understanding both generals' plans and the feel of mud in a trench, Clark integrates all aspects of Anzio in this high-quality battle history. <i>Gilbert Taylor</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

The course of the war is divided into six passages and attached to each is an analytical narrative of a battle, which exemplifies a mode of warfare special to this war, such as city sieges, an air battle, an airborne operation, an aircraft carrier battle, a tank battle and an amphibious landing. The author takes as his starting point the outcome of the First World War, and what it meant in particular for the defeated nations, and how the developed world reacted to its first experience of mass warfare. He surveys the strategic positioning of all the major combatants to summarize the strategic progress of the war. In addition all the major ancillary activities to which the war gave rise are discussed: war supply, war production, strategic bombing, occupation and repression, espionage and resistance, and the secret weapons programmes.</p><p>The best one-volume treatment available, <i>The Second World War</i> by John Keegan is an outstanding synthesis of an enormous amount of material on "the largest single event in human history." The book proceeds chronologically through the war, but chapters appearing at appropriate moments focus on particular themes, such as war production, occupation, bombing, resistance, and espionage. Keegan's ability to translate the war's grand strategies is impressive, and the battle descriptions are superb. Generals obviously play a key role in this narrative, but ordinary soldiers also receive proper credit, as do the often-overlooked merchant marines whose heroic efforts to supply Great Britain made the Allied victory possible. Keegan, author of the landmark book <i>The Face of Battle</i>, is without doubt one of our greatest military historians, and here his analytical powers and skilled writing are on full display.John Keegan is the Defence Editor of the Daily Telegraph and Britain&#39;s foremost military historian. The Reith Lecturer in 1998, he is the author of many bestselling books including The Face of Battle, Six Armies in Normandy, Battle at Sea, The Second World War, A History of Warfare (awarded the Duff Cooper Prize), Warpaths, The Battle for History, The First World War, and most recently, Intelligence in War. For many years John Keegan was the Senior Lecturer in Military History at the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst, and he has been a Fellow of Princeton University and Delmas Distinguished Professor of History at Vassar. He is a Fellow of the Royal Society of Literature. He received the OBE in the Gulf War honours list, and was knighted in the Millennium honours list in 1999.

This was the first time that the Roman Empire was gradually replaced by barbarian invaders, who spread through Europe and created new styles of jewelry; it was also when the capital shifted eastward to the newly founded city of Constantinople.<br><br>Among the themes treated are the transition from Late Roman types to Byzantine ones, including the design of new shapes; an interest in exotic stones and changes in fashion; the function of rings (marriage, personal monograms, official status and religious iconography); and the Western Gothic imitation and development of Byzantine prototypes.<br><br>Examples from the early third and fourth centuries in Rome feature an elaborate 'key' ring, pierced with the words utere felix (use with luck) and an ornate yet sophisticated band set entirely with emeralds. There is a late fifth-century Byzantine Parure that includes a pendant cross and related earrings. From the same era, an Ostogothic group is comprised of polyhedral earrings, a pendant cross and a ring, all with beautiful garnet inlay.<br><br>Jeffrey Spier is a university associate and adjunct professor at the University of Arizona.

The perceptive Chief Cornplanter, realizing that his people must adapt to new social and economic patterns, welcomed the Quakers as teachers, not so much for their religion, but for their knowledge of agriculture. The interactions between the two groups brought on conflicts among the Senecas and new developments in their culture, among them the rise of the powerful prophet Handsome Lake and his Longhouse religion. The author shows how Simmons and Cornplanter each attained a grasp of the other&#39;s religion, politics, and lifestyles and were able to mutually achieve their goals by finding the similarities and utilizing them.

He is coming of age in the despair-sodden world of moonshine whiskey in easter Kentucky&#39;s mining country in the early 1960s. The mine owners and the union are at war , the striking miners and the company scabs are at war, and Pett must somehow survive. At sixteen years old, Perry sets himself three tasks: avenge his father&#39;s murder; improve his and his family&#39;s lot; and escape to Cincinnati to find a &#34;high-paying&#34; job. But conditions in the hollows, his fellow miners, and his own anger and despair make for formidable obstacles. With the lure of seedy &#34;watering holes&#34; beckoning him, Perry must navigate the tempestuous journey from boyhood to manhood.</p><p>James Lee Burke is the <i>New York Times</i> bestselling, Edgar Award-winning author of twenty-four novels, including eighteen starring the Cajun detective Dave Robicheaux. Burke grew up on the Texas-Louisiana Gulf Coast, where he now lives with his wife Pearl. They also spend several months a year in Montana.To the Bright and Shining Sun <br> <br>CHAPTER<br> <br> <br> <br>ONE<br> <br>THREE MEN AND a boy sat in the dark in a battered 1958 Ford on a shale road that wound along the base of the mountain. One of them smoked a hand-rolled cigarette in the cup of his hands, bending down his head below the level of the windows whenever he drew in the smoke. The first leaves were shedding from the trees, and they rattled dryly along the road in the wind. Around the curve of the road was the coal tipple, huge and looming over the railway tracks that led past the mine opening down towards the switch where the C &amp; O made up the long freight cars that would eventually take the coal to Pittsburgh. The boy, Perry Woodson Hatfield James, sat in the backseat with one hand gripped tightly under his thigh and the other over his wrist. He could feel the sweat form under his arms and run cold down his sides. He believed that if fear had a smell it would already have soaked through his clothes and permeated everything in the car. He could smell it in himself every time he took a breath. It was a rancid odor, like something dead in the sun. Big J.W. and Little J.W. sat in the front, immobile against the glow of the moon except when Little J.W. bent to smoke off the cigarette. They were half brothers, both fathered by a North Carolina moonshiner who was killed at the age of seventy-six in the dirt streets of Harlan while giving whiskey free to the miners when John L. Lewis first organized the coal fields and the National Guard was sent in by the state to shoot down a man who tried to stop a scab from crossing the picket.<br> <br>Big J.W. wore a tin hat down low on his forehead, and his skin was grained with coal dust, rubbed so deep around the corners of his eyes that it looked like a burn. The faded pinstriped coat he wore over his overalls was stretched almost to tearing across his angular shoulders, and the knobs on his wrist looked like white bones sticking out of his sleeves. His teeth were yellow and long, and his fingernails were as thick and hard as tortoiseshell, broken to the quick and colored with blue-black half-moons. His wife cut his hair with a straight-edged razor, and it hung unevenly over the back of his neck like a girl&#x2019;s. Little J.W. was a small round man with a hard, little, round stomach that pushed against his work trousers. He was thought to be an invaluable man in the mines because he could go a half mile up and down a narrow shaft on his hands and knees like a groundhog. His soft, brown eyes and quiet mountain accent caused few people to pay any particular attention to him except when there was an explosion or cave-in down in the hole and somebody was needed to crawl through the fallen limestone and timbers to some gas-filled pocket deep in the earth where no sane person would go. But those who knew him well realized that he was a much more dangerous person than Big J.W., and when set in motion he would go at something or someone with the quiet rage of a hot iron scorched across wood. Once, he and an uncle argued while drinking, and after the uncle drew a knife, Little J.W. hit him six times in the head with a poker and threw him off the front porch of the company cabin into the yard. &#x201c;Pull a knife on me, will you,&#x201d; he said, the poker still in his hand. &#x201c;Pull one against your own blood, will you. Well, if you get home by yourself that&#x2019;s all right with me, and by God if you die out here in the lot that&#x2019;s all right with me, too.&#x201d;<br> <br>On the back floor of the car, under a blanket, were a lever-action 30-caliber Winchester, a double-barreled twelve-gauge with the barrels sawed off two inches in front of the chambers, fourteen cans of dynamite, three primers, and a four-hundred-foot spool of cap wire. The boy also knew that each of the three men with him carried a .38, since they would no more leave home without it than they would without their trousers.<br> <br>&#x201c;It ain&#x2019;t we got to blow it,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Maybe just set it up on the mountain and push some rock down on the hole.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I done told you, honey,&#x201d; Big J.W. said. &#x201c;We&#x2019;re a-blowing that tipple right over on the moneyman&#x2019;s head. We didn&#x2019;t risk no year in Frankfort breaking open the shack just to move some rock around.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Moon&#x2019;s a-setting,&#x201d; Little J.W. said.<br> <br>&#x201c;Get them charges out, Perry,&#x201d; Bee, the man next to the boy, said. He was the boy&#x2019;s uncle, a tall man who had to stoop slightly so his head wouldn&#x2019;t hit the top of the car. Like Big J.W., he wore overalls, with a leather belt around his waist, and a suitcoat and a cloth slug cap on his head. Years ago he had lost his dentures, and his mouth was collapsed in rows of thick creases around his lips. His gums were blackened from the wad of snuff that was always under his tongue. During the forties he did two years in the Kentucky penitentiary for shooting a company deputy, and because he had refused to name any of the other men who shot three more company men in the same battle, he was made a business agent for the United Mine Workers when he was paroled. He rasped and coughed into his sleeve. He&#x2019;d had silicosis since he was twenty-five from working in the mines before the companies had been forced to put ventilation systems in the shaft.<br> <br>&#x201c;What if them scabs is there?&#x201d; Perry said.<br> <br>&#x201c;They&#x2019;re a-going right with it,&#x201d; Big J.W. said. &#x201c;They can steal food out of a man&#x2019;s mouth down in hell if they&#x2019;ve still a mind for it.&#x201d;<br> <br>Bee tore the blanket off the explosives and guns. &#x201c;Now you build them charges,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;By God, there ain&#x2019;t nobody saying a James or a Hatfield puts a scab before a workingman.&#x201d;<br> <br>The boy screwed the cans end to end, tightening each socket securely. He built the charges in cylinders of four cans each, with a primer on the butt end of each row. The sweat on his hands was cold against the metal. There&#x2019;s enough here to put half the mountain down in the holler, he thought. Them four hundred feet of wire ain&#x2019;t even going to give us running distance. We&#x2019;ll be a-setting here with rocks big as cars coming down on us. I seen them drop a charge like this on Black Mountain in Harlan once, and the trees and rocks burst all over the sun. The dust stayed black across the crest of the ridge until twilight when it started to rain. He wished he was back home in the cabin now, with the dry poplar logs and huge coal lumps burning in the blackened sandstone fireplace. He was too afraid to care whether he worked union or not. Maybe the operator ain&#x2019;t wrong, he thought. Maybe he can&#x2019;t afford to pay scale, and it ain&#x2019;t nothing but trouble to push union in the coal field. We was doing all right with what they was giving us. Twelve dollars a day is more than we&#x2019;re a-getting on the picket. There wasn&#x2019;t no shooting and no company men coming around the houses asking where the men was at the night before. We didn&#x2019;t have nobody cutting off our charge at the store. And on Saturday afternoon a feller had a hard dollar in his pocket to ride the bus into Winfro Valley for the Barn Dance that&#x2019;s over the radio.<br> <br>Then he felt an old secret shame inside him at his fear. His people had been against the operator since his grandfather had had his mineral rights stolen out from under him for fifty cents an acre by a New York sharper&#x2014;an eastern feller, with a gold watch that must have cost a hundred dollars hanging on his vest, his grandfather had said. He set down at your table and told ye how good your fatback and greens was and how the half dollar would pay the county tax and said the land wasn&#x2019;t good for anything no way. Bought up the whole holler for no more than the price of that train ticket from New York. And didn&#x2019;t tell nobody that what ye signed give the operator the right to do whatever he wanted to the top of the land. They could tear away the mountain and let it slide all across your tobacco crop, there wasn&#x2019;t nothing ye could do about it except go to work for him.<br> <br>Perry knew that no James or Hatfield in his family had ever been afraid of operators, company thugs, strikebreakers with their axe handles, or even the National Guard. His grandfather said he was related to Frank James, the outlaw who hid out in the Cumberland after robbing a bank with Jesse over in West Virginia, and his mother was a direct descendant of Devil Anse Hatfield, who killed McCoys all over Pike and Logan counties. His family had been union people even before John L. Lewis and the CIO organized the coal field. They had fought side by side with the organizers from the National Miners Union before the Great Depression, when the man who breathed the word &#x201c;union&#x201d; was fired from his job, evicted from his company-owned cabin, maybe run out of the county by the sheriff, and sometimes shot and thrown down the hollow.<br> <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s dark enough now,&#x201d; Big J.W. said. &#x201c;Hand baby brother up the shotgun.&#x201d;<br> <br>Perry gave Little J.W. the sawed-off double-barrel and watched against the door.<br> <br>The entrance to the mine was a dark, square gap in the face of the mountain. Farther down, a huge slag heap was smoking in the cold. Since the time he was a small child Perry could not remember ever having been near a mine without smelling the odor of burning slag. It was a fire that never went out because its source of fuel was never stopped, and the air around his home always had the same acrid stench to it. The coal from the tipple spilled across the road into a black slide and down the gulley into a stream. Next to the road a discarded sign on a wooden stick, left from the day&#x2019;s picketing, was propped at an angle against a rock. It read in crude, hand-printed letters: this mine unfair it dont hire union men.<br> <br>&#x201c;They didn&#x2019;t leave no guard,&#x201d; Little J.W. said.<br> <br>&#x201c;Watch that opening. Them scabs might be a-drawing right down on my windshield now,&#x201d; Big J.W. said. &#x201c;Remember when they shot up Noah Combs? He never knew where they was at till he was right up on the shaft.&#x201d;<br> <br>Bee took the .38 special from the bib pocket of his overalls and let it rest in his palm against his leg. Big J.W. drove past the tipple a hundred yards and stopped the car under an overhang of pine trees. The base of the burning slag heap glowed red in the breeze. Down in the hollow Perry could hear the bats squeaking through the darkness as they swept in circles over the creek.<br> <br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t do no talking when we&#x2019;re out of the car,&#x201d; Big J.W. said. &#x201c;And if you see a scab, drop him fast before he gets off a shot. He hits one of them primers and they&#x2019;ll have to scrub us off the mountain.&#x201d;<br> <br>The four of them got out of the car onto the road. The wind against the sweat on Perry&#x2019;s face made him cold. He and Big J.W. each carried two sticks of charges; they held the spool of cap wire between them with an iron pipe stuck through the center. They moved up the mountain towards the tipple, over the scattered lumps of coal and slag. The rocks rolling down under their boots and hands sounded to Perry like an avalanche crashing into the hollow. There ain&#x2019;t no sense in it, he thought. You ain&#x2019;t got to blow half the county to let them know we wasn&#x2019;t working for no one-twenty-five. There ain&#x2019;t going to be no work anyhow when the tipple goes.<br> <br>Before they got to the base of the tipple, Little J.W. and Bee dropped to one knee and pointed their guns to each side of the structure. Bee held his .38 straight ahead of him, with his left hand gripped around his wrist to steady his aim. The boy and Big J.W. moved up to the steel stanchions sunk in concrete that supported the weight of the tipple. Perry&#x2019;s fingers felt thick and uncoordinated as he and Big J.W. placed the charges around a stanchion on the downhill side of the mountain and wrapped them securely with baling wire. Big J.W. pulled the end of the cap wire loose from the spool and carefully set the small plastic tube of gelatin detonator across a primer head and wound it over with electrician&#x2019;s tape. Then he took the spool of wire and made two turns around the bottom of the stanchion and tied a sailor&#x2019;s bowknot in it so that the tube of gelatin would not pull loose when they strung the wire downhill.<br> <br>Big J.W. grabbed the boy&#x2019;s arm hard and pulled him into a crouch beside him. Several rocks rolled past them from above. They waited in the dark, hardly breathing, while the bats squeaked and whirled above them. Little J.W. and Bee looked like carved soldiers, frozen in their positions. Run now, the boy thought. Drop the wire and take off across the road into the holler. It ain&#x2019;t cowardice to run from getting shot at. People in wars do it. They didn&#x2019;t say nothing about shooting. It ain&#x2019;t fair to get shot at when you ain&#x2019;t got a gun.<br> <br>&#x201c;Set, boy,&#x201d; Big J.W. whispered fiercely, his hand tightening on Perry&#x2019;s arm.<br> <br>&#x201c;We can&#x2019;t even see them. They&#x2019;ll tear us up soon as we get in the open.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Shut.&#x201d; This time the hand clenched so tightly over his arm that the boy thought his blood veins were pressed flat against the bone.<br> <br>They waited five minutes under the tipple, each with his hand squeezed hard on the iron bar that held the spool of wire, the slag cutting into their knees. Perry felt that even if a small rock was set in motion by the point of his boot, a volley of shotgun and rifle fire would open up that would blow him backwards like a pile of rags onto the road.<br> <br>&#x201c;Start stringing it,&#x201d; Big J.W. said. They crawled down the mountain between the two other men while Big J.W. pulled the cap wire off the spool with one hand and laid it out evenly behind them. Bee&#x2019;s extended arm was as rigid as a thick piece of wood as he kept his pistol pointed towards the top of the rise, his jaws sucking slowly on the saliva-smooth lump of snuff in his mouth. He started to cough once and pressed his palm across his face, spitting tobacco juice all over himself in a dry rasp. Perry knew that somewhere up there in the dark a man had the V-sight of a carbine lined in on the nape of his neck, and involuntarily he kept touching the back of his head with his hand. I wouldn&#x2019;t be afraid if they give me a gun, he thought. Them company guards ain&#x2019;t likely to stick to a fight when they get shot back at. Big J.W. wouldn&#x2019;t be a-grabbing on to me like he was something unless he had that special in his pocket.<br> <br>He felt that a gun would be like a piece of magic in his pocket. He knew the heart-pounding and heavy breathing would stop if he could feel a .38 stuck hard down inside his trousers with the hammer on half cock. A gun was something smooth and lovely that fitted into the curve of a man&#x2019;s palm as though it were an extension of his arm. You could hold scabs and company deputies at a distance with it, and you didn&#x2019;t have to be afraid of a man letting off a shotgun at you from the dark opening of a mine shaft. Noah Combs wouldn&#x2019;t have been shot up if he&#x2019;d had his revolver in his hand rather than in his glove compartment when the company guards hit him from both sides of the road.<br> <br>Perry and Big J.W. made the road and strung out the last of the wire to the automobile. Big J.W. unlatched the hood, raised it carefully, and pulled the cap off of a spark plug. Little J.W. and Bee moved backwards down the mountain, with their guns still pointed in front of them.

Newett and his wife Amanda Todd lived in the gated community of Heron Bay Estates until its destruction by a fluke tornado. This event, Newett notes, occurred on the 77th anniversary of the 1929 stock market crash, a detail that would appear insignificant if it were not for several subsequent events. The stress of the tornado&#x2019;s devastation prompts the Newett-Todds to depart on a European vacation, during which George suffers a fall on none other than his 77th birthday, the first day of autumn (or more cryptically, Fall). Following this coincidence, George experiences the first of what is to become five serial visions, each appearing to him on the first day of the ensuing seasons, and each corresponding to a pivotal event in that season of his life.<br><br>As the novel unfolds, so do these uncanny coincidences, and it is clear that, as ever, Barth possesses an unmatched talent in balancing his characteristic style and wit with vivid, page-turning storytelling.<br></p><p>Praise for <i>Every Third Thought</i><br><br>"<i>Every Third Thought</i> has more to say about life, death, the "human condition," and maybe most particularly and surprisingly the deathlessness of love (bref: not Time's fool), than an entire constellation of newer, prettier literary lights." &#x2014;<i>Los Angeles Review of Books</i><br><br>"Barth delivers yet another playful romp through the lives of characters both imprisoned and liberated by their constant urge to tell stories in language that shifts shape as constantly as their lives shift spaces . . .

He was twice nominated for the Pulitzer Prize in fiction and won a number of other awards, including the Western Writers Award for Lifetime Achievement.The frontier of the Old West has rarely been evoked as a more miserable, barren land than it is in this melancholy novel by the author of The Shootist. After venturing west of the Missouri to stake claims in uncharted territory, a number of settlers find the earth fallow and the desolate, lonely winters unbearable. When four of the wives go mad, the local minister entrusts a prim, strong-willed young schoolmarm, Mary Bee Cuddy, to transport them back to Iowa by covered wagon. With her, virtually against his will, is Briggs, a dishonest, foul-mouthed land-grabber (he steals other peoples' claims) whom Mary Bee saved from a lynching in exchange for his help. Utilizing a classic western plota journey across rough land under perilous conditionsand a mismatched pair of protagonists who'll remind many readers of those in The African Queen , the author tells a sturdy if by now familiar tale. Unfortunately, once the novel goes wrong, which it does with a bizarre, alienating plot twist about three-quarters of the way through, it never recovers. <br>Copyright 1988 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Island</h2><p>For over a hundred years, the inhabitants of the Pacific island of Pala have been part of a social experiment whereby western science has been brought together with eastern philosophy and humanism to create a paradise on earth.

He covers different investment styles, market cycles, when to buy and sell, managing a portfolio, and even handling estate matters, all from his own unique experiences as investor and investment consultant. Some of the recommendations may be beyond the average investor (such as having one reliable local source of information in a foreign country), as may some of the analysis-e.g., "doing a spreadsheet for each company you own." But in general the work is accessible, realistic, and filled with amusing snippets. You can make something of yourself, argues Train, "if you are always honest, energetic, and careful." May it be so.

Here Severin becomes interested in the possibility of travel and cultural exchange across the Pacific prior to the European discovery of America. He recounts arguments of cultural specialists and puts forth the theory that bamboo rafts were the most likely craft used by Asian navigators of the time. The bulk of the book recounts the building of a raft in Vietnam, the gathering of a crew, and the attempt to reach California via the Kuroshio and the North Pacific currents. There is some good incidental information about Vietnam and the character of Severin's multinational crew. But there is mind-numbing detail of bad meals and dangerous weather situations, as well as the slow deterioration of the raft. Thorough, accurate, and intelligent, this work is not as exciting as the general public might desire.?William R. Smith, Johns Hopkins Univ. Lib., Baltimore<br>Copyright 1995 Reed Business Information, Inc.Severin has undertaken previous adventures inspired by historical journeys of significance. His latest expedition was motivated in part by the findings of experts who believed it possible that a Chinese explorer crossed from Asia to America perhaps 2,000 years ago on a bamboo raft. In what Severin considered to be an archeological experiment, a replica raft was built in Vietnam and christened <i>Hsu Fu</i>, after the revered mariner. Severin and his crew of four then set sail from Hong Kong to Tokyo before embarking on a crossing of the North Pacific. This rousing account of the journey is vividly detailed, never dreary. Nearly 1,000 miles off the Mendocino coast, these persistent sailors finally had to abandon the ancient seafaring craft that up to that point had served them so well. <i>Alice Joyce</i></p><h2>A Misplaced Massacre: Struggling over the Memory of Sand Creek</h2><p><p>In the early morning of November 29, 1864, with the fate of the Union still uncertain, part of the First Colorado and nearly all of the Third Colorado volunteer regiments, commanded by Colonel John Chivington, surprised hundreds of Cheyenne and Arapaho people camped on the banks of Sand Creek in southeastern Colorado Territory. More than 150 Native Americans were slaughtered, the vast majority of them women, children, and the elderly, making it one of the most infamous cases of state-sponsored violence in U.S. history. <i>A Misplaced Massacre</i> examines the ways in which generations of Americans have struggled to come to terms with the meaning of both the attack and its aftermath, most publicly at the 2007 opening of the Sand Creek Massacre National Historic Site.</p><p> </p><p> This site opened after a long and remarkably contentious planning process. Native Americans, Colorado ranchers, scholars, Park Service employees, and politicians alternately argued and allied with one another around the question of whether the nation&#x2019;s crimes, as well as its achievements, should be memorialized. Ari Kelman unearths the stories of those who lived through the atrocity, as well as those who grappled with its troubling legacy, to reveal how the intertwined histories of the conquest and colonization of the American West and the U.S. Civil War left enduring national scars.</p><p> </p><p> Combining painstaking research with storytelling worthy of a novel, <i>A Misplaced Massacre</i> probes the intersection of history and memory, laying bare the ways differing groups of Americans come to know a shared past.</p></p><p>Ari Kelman is McCabe Greer Professor of the American Civil War Era at Pennsylvania State University.Brilliant and beautifully written&#x2014;a powerful meditation on the long shadows that the past continues to cast into the present.

Tokyo resident Azby Brown, a distinguished architect and designer, has assembled dozens of creative solutions to space and storage problems, illustrating them with photographs and plans of actual living environments in contemporary homes. <br><br>The key to his approach is what might be called "The Three Cs "-compact, comfortable, and convenient. Use of space is reconsidered, with easy living always the uppermost goal. A living room is opened up by creating level changes or "joining it with the exterior." A staircase can double as a chest of drawers, a space beneath the floor can serve as a kitchen pantry or hiding place for a disappearing bed: an adjustable table can serve different purposes at different heights. From top to bottom, in bedroom, bathroom, kitchen and hall, Azby Brown presents solutions to the problems of inner space, illustrated with dozens of full-color photographs, drawings, and architectural plans. <br><br><em>Small Spaces</em> will be a lifesaver for all those with growing families, shrinking resources, and limited room to grow-or indeed anyone who wants to transform a disorganized, cluttered environment into an orderly, attractive living area.</p><p>Drawing upon the sparse tranquility of Japanese design, architect and Tokyo resident Azby Brown explains how to live comfortably in limited or overcrowded domains. By rethinking our approach to space, utilizing seemingly dead areas (under-floor or under-stairs storage, for example), creating multipurpose or convertible areas, and reconsidering layout, we can make the most of what we have. Some of these homes carry Eastern minimalism to an extreme that clutter-prone Westerners may not be comfortable with, but there are plenty of ingenious furniture, storage, and planning solutions nevertheless. <i>--Amy Handy</i><br>AZBY BROWN is an architect who has lived in Japan since 1985.

A Civil War veteran, Bierce had absolutely no illusions about "courage," "honor," and "glory" on the battlefield. These stories form one of the great antiwar statements in American literature. Included here are the classic <i>An Occurrence at Owl Creek Bridge,</i> <i>Chickamauga</i>, <i>The Mocking Bird</i>, <i>The Coup de Gr�ce</i>, <i>Parker Anderson</i>, <i>Philosopher</i>, and other stories celebrated for their intensity, startling insight, and mastery of form.</p><p>Journalist, short story writer, and satirist Ambrose Bierce (1842-1914) was equally adept in a variety of genres, from ghost stories to poetry to political commentary. Bierce&#39;s fiction is particularly distinguished by its realistic depictions of the author&#39;s Civil War experiences."He will remain one of our greatest wits, one of our most uncompromising satirists, the perfecter of two or three new genres."&#x2014;Clifton Fadiman (Clifton Fadiman)<br><br>"Bierce's war stories are. . .arresting, often shocking accounts of the incivilities perpetrated by and on men suddenly confronting their own mortality."&#x2014;Cathy N.

Local, national, and international newspapers, medical and scientific publications, and popular fiction writers all clamored to cover the ensuing &#x201c;girl lovers&#x201d; murder trial. Lisa Duggan locates in this sensationalized event the emergence of the lesbian in U.S. mass culture and shows how newly &#x201c;modern&#x201d; notions of normality and morality that arose from such cases still haunt and distort lesbian and gay politics to the present day.<br> Situating this story alongside simultaneously circulating lynching narratives (and its resistant versions, such as those of Memphis antilynching activist Ida B. Wells) Duggan reveals how stories of sex and violence were crucial to the development of American modernity. While careful to point out the differences between the public reigns of terror that led to many lynchings and the rarer instances of the murder of one woman by another privately motivated woman, Duggan asserts that dominant versions of both sets of stories contributed to the marginalization of African Americans and women while solidifying a distinctly white, male, heterosexual form of American citizenship. Having explored the role of turn-of-the-century print media&#x2014;and in particular their tendency toward sensationalism&#x2014;Duggan moves next to a review of sexology literature and to novels, most notably Radclyffe Hall&#x2019;s <i>The Well of Loneliness</i>. <i>Sapphic Slashers</i> concludes with two appendices, one of which presents a detailed summary of Ward&#x2019;s murder, the trial, and Mitchell&#x2019;s eventual institutionalization. The other presents transcriptions of letters exchanged between the two women prior to the crime.<br> Combining cultural history, feminist and queer theory, narrative analysis, and compelling storytelling, <i>Sapphic Slashers</i> provides the first history of the emergence of the lesbian in twentieth-century mass culture.<p></p><p></p></p><p>&#x201c;What Duggan does in this original and moving book is take a murder case from 1890&#x2019;s Memphis and make of it a prism through which to illuminate American modernity. Her method depends less on an account of the murder or of the judicial procedure that followed it than on an analysis of the many narratives&#x2014;of lesbian love and sex and madness&#x2014;that the case occasioned. Juxtaposing these narratives to narratives of lynching, Duggan produces a tour-de-force of historical understanding.&#x201d;&#x2014;Henry Abelove, Wesleyan University <p>&#x201c;A book to die for!

With zero leads and no apparent motive, it&#x2019;s another case destined for the cold file&#x2013;until Petra decides to follow her instincts and descends into a world of traveling grifters and bloodthirsty killers, pursuing a possible eyewitness whose life is in mortal danger.<br><br>Finding her elusive quarry&#x2013;alive&#x2013;isn&#x2019;t all Petra has on her plate: departmental politics threatens to sabotage her case, and her personal life isn&#x2019;t doing much better. If all that wasn&#x2019;t enough, Isaac Gomez, a whiz-kid grad student researching homicide statistics at the station house, is convinced he&#x2019;s stumbled upon a bizarre connection between several unsolved murders. The victims had nothing in common, yet each died by the same method, on the same date&#x2013;a date that&#x2019;s rapidly approaching again. And that leaves Petra with little time to unravel the twisted logic of a cunning predator who&#x2019;s evaded detection for years&#x2013;and whose terrible hour is once more at hand.<br><br>&#x201c;Why is it so hard to put down a Kellerman thriller?&#x201d; asks Publishers Weekly. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s simple: the nonstop action leaves you breathless; the plot twists keep you guessing; the themes . . . are provocative.&#x201d; Those in need of still further proof that &#x201c;Kellerman has shaped the psychological mystery novel into an art form&#x201d; (Los Angeles Times Book Review) need look no further than Twisted.</p><p>JONATHAN KELLERMAN is one of the world&#x2019;s most popular authors. He has brought his expertise as a clinical psychologist to numerous bestselling tales of suspense (which have been translated into two dozen languages), including the Alex Delaware novels, The Butcher&#x2019;s Theater, Billy Straight, and Therapy.

Jonathan Kellerman lives in California and has four children.CHAPTER 1<br><br>May brought azure skies and California optimism to Hollywood. Petra Connor worked nights and slept through the blue. She had her own reason to be cheerful: solving two whodunit murders.<br><br>The first was a dead body at a wedding. The Ito-Park wedding, main ballroom of the Roosevelt Hotel, Japanese-American bride, Korean-American groom, a couple of law students who&#x2019;d met at the U. Her father, a Glendale-born surgeon; his, an immigrant appliance dealer, barely able to speak English. Petra wondered about culture clash.<br><br>The body was one of the bride&#x2019;s cousins, a thirty-two-year-old CPA named Baldwin Yoshimura, found midway through the reception, in an unlocked stall of the hotel men&#x2019;s room, his neck twisted so hard, he looked like something out of The Exorcist. It took strong hands to do that, the coroner pronounced, but that was where the medical wisdom terminated.<br><br>Petra, working with no partner once again, talked to every friend and relative and finally unearthed the fact that Baldwin Yoshimura had been a serious lothario who&#x2019;d made no distinction between married and unmarried conquests. As she continued to probe, she encountered nervous glances on the bride&#x2019;s side. Finally, a third cousin named Wendy Sakura blurted out the truth: Baldwin had been fooling with his brother Darwin&#x2019;s wife. The slut.<br><br>Darwin, a relative black sheep for this highly educated clan, was a martial arts instructor who worked at a studio in Woodland Hills. Petra forced herself to wake up during daylight, dropped in at the dojo, watched him put an advanced judo class through its paces. Stocky little guy, shaved head, pleasant demeanor. When the class was over, he approached Petra, arms extended for cuffing, saying, &#x201c;I did it. Arrest me.&#x201d;<br><br>Back at the station, he refused a lawyer, couldn&#x2019;t wait to spill: Suspicious for some time, he&#x2019;d followed his wife and his brother as they left the wedding and entered an unused banquet room. After passing behind a partition, said wife gave said sib enthusiastic head. Darwin allowed her to finish, waited until Baldwin went to the john, confronted his brother, did the deed.<br><br>&#x201c;What about your wife?&#x201d; said Petra.<br><br>&#x201c;What about her?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You didn&#x2019;t hurt her.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;She&#x2019;s a woman,&#x201d; said Darwin Yoshimura. &#x201c;She&#x2019;s weak. Baldwin should&#x2019;ve known better.&#x201d;<br>The second whodunit started off as bloodstains in Los Feliz and ended up with d.b. out in Angeles Crest National Forest. This victim was a grocer named Bedros Kashigian. The blood was found in the parking lot behind his market on Edgemont. Kashigian and his five-year-old Cadillac were missing.<br><br>Two days later, forest rangers found the Caddy pulled to the side of the road in the forest, Kashigian&#x2019;s body slumped behind the wheel. Dried blood had streamed out of his left ear, run onto his face and shirt, but no obvious wounds. Maggot analysis said he&#x2019;d been dead the entire two days, or close to it. Meaning, instead of driving home from work, he&#x2019;d made his way thirty miles east. Or had been taken there.<br><br>As far as Petra could tell, the grocer was a solid citizen, married, three kids, nice house, no outstanding debts. But a solid week of investigating Kashigian&#x2019;s activities gave rise to the fact that he&#x2019;d been involved in a brawl two days before his disappearance.<br><br>Barroom melee at a place on Alvarado. Latino clientele, but Kashigian had a thing for one of the Salvadoran waitresses and went there frequently to nurse beer-and-shots before retiring to her room above the saloon. The fracas got going when two drunks started pounding each other. Kashigian got caught in the middle and ended up being punched in the head. Only once, according to the bartender. An errant bare fist and Kashigian had left the bar on his feet.<br><br>Kashigian&#x2019;s widow, dealing with her loss as well as the new insight that Bedros had been cheating on her, said hubby had complained of a headache, attributing it to banging his head against a bread rack. Couple of aspirins, he&#x2019;d seemed fine.<br><br>Petra phoned the coroner, an unconscionably cheerful guy named Rosenberg, and asked if a single, bare-knuckle blow to the head could be fatal two days after the fact. Rosenberg said he doubted it.<br><br>A scan of Bedros Kashigian&#x2019;s insurance records showed hefty whole life and first-to-die policies as well as medical claims paid five years ago, when the grocer had been involved in a nine-car pileup on the 5 North that had shattered his skull and caused intracranial bleeding. Brought into the E.R. unconscious, Kashigian had been wheeled into surgery where a half-dollar-sized piece of skull had been sawed off so his brain could be cleaned up. That section, labeled a &#x201c;roundel&#x201d; by Rosenberg, had been reattached using sutures and screws.<br><br>After hearing about the accident, Rosenberg had changed his mind.<br><br>&#x201c;The roundel was anchored by scar tissue,&#x201d; he told Petra. &#x201c;And the darn thing grew back thinner than the rest of the skull. Unfortunately for your guy, that&#x2019;s exactly where he took the punch. The rest of his head could have withstood the impact but the thin spot couldn&#x2019;t. It shattered, drove bone slivers into his brain, caused a slow bleed, and finally boom.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Boom,&#x201d; said Petra. &#x201c;There you go again, blinding me with jargon.&#x201d;<br><br>The coroner laughed. Petra laughed. Neither of them wanting to think about Bedros Kashigian&#x2019;s monumental bad luck.<br><br>&#x201c;A single punch,&#x201d; she said.<br><br>&#x201c;Boom,&#x201d; said Rosenberg.<br><br>&#x201c;Tell me this, Doctor R., could he have driven to the forest out of confusion?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Let me think about that. With shards of bone slicing into his gray matter, a slow bleed, yeah, he could&#x2019;ve been hazy, disoriented.&#x201d;<br><br>Which didn&#x2019;t explain why Angeles Crest, specifically.<br><br>She asked Captain Schoelkopf if she should pursue homicide charges against the guy who&#x2019;d landed the punch.<br><br>&#x201c;Who is he?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t know yet.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;A bar fight.&#x201d; Schoelkopf flashed her the are-you-retarded? look. &#x201c;Write it up as an accidental death.&#x201d;<br><br>Lacking the will&#x2014;or the desire&#x2014;to argue, she complied, then went to inform the widow. Who told her Angeles Crest was where she and Bedros used to go to make out when they were teenagers.<br><br>&#x201c;At least he left me some good insurance,&#x201d; said the woman. &#x201c;The main thing is my kids stay in private school.&#x201d;<br>Within days after closing both files, the loneliness set in. Petra had made the mistake of getting intimate with a partner, and now she was working and living solo.<br><br>The object of her affections was a strange, taciturn detective named Eric Stahl with a military background as an Army special services officer and a history that had unfurled slowly. The first time Petra had seen his black suit, pale skin, and flat, dark eyes she&#x2019;d thought undertaker. She&#x2019;d disliked him instinctively and the feeling appeared mutual. Somehow things had changed.<br><br>They&#x2019;d started working together on the Cold Heart homicides, coordinating with Milo Sturgis in West L.A. to put away a scumbag psychopath who got off on dispatching creative types. Closing that one hadn&#x2019;t come easy; Eric had nearly died of stab wounds. Sitting, waiting, in the E.R. waiting room, Petra had met his parents, learned why he didn&#x2019;t talk or emote or act remotely human.<br><br>He&#x2019;d once had a family&#x2014;wife and two kids&#x2014;but had lost everything. Heather, Danny, and Dawn. Taken from him cruelly. He&#x2019;d resigned his military commission, spent a year doped up on antidepressants, then applied to the LAPD, where connections got him a Detective I appointment, Hollywood Division, where Schoelkopf had foisted him on Petra.<br><br>Whatever Schoelkopf knew he&#x2019;d kept to himself. Uninformed, Petra tried to get along, but faced with a partner with all the warmth of ceramic tile, she soon gave up. The two of them ended up splitting chores, minimizing the time they spent together. Long, cold, silent stakeouts.<br><br>Then came a night full of terror. Even now, Petra wondered if Eric had been trying to commit Suicide by Perp. She&#x2019;d never brought it up. Had no reason to.<br><br>She had not been the only woman in his life. During the Cold Heart investigation, he&#x2019;d met an exotic dancer, a bubble-headed blonde with a perfect body named Kyra Montego aka Kathy Magary. Kyra was there in the waiting room, too, stuffed into too-small duds, sniffling into her hankie, examining her nails, unable to read the dumbest magazine out of anxiety or what Petra suspected was attention span disorder. Petra outlasted the bimbo, and when Eric woke up, it was her hand holding his, her eyes locking with his bruised, brown irises.<br><br>During the months of recuperation, Kyra kept dropping in at Eric&#x2019;s rented bungalow in Studio City, bearing takeout soup and plastic utensils. Offering plastic boobs and batting eyelashes and Lord knew what else.<br><br>Petra dealt with that by cooking for Eric. Growing up with five brothers and a widowed father in Arizona, she&#x2019;d learned to be pretty handy around the kitchen. During the brief time her marriage lasted, she&#x2019;d played at gourmet. Now a nighthawk divorc�e, she rarely bothered to switch on the oven. But healing Eric with home-cooked goodies had seemed terribly urgent.<br><br>In the end, the bimbo was out of the picture and Petra was squarely in it. She and Eric went from awkwardness to reluctant self-disclosure to friendship to closeness. When they finally made love, he went at it with the fervor of a deprived animal. When they finally settled into regular sex, she found him the best lover she&#x2019;d ever encountered, tender when she needed him to be, accommodatingly athletic when that w...</p><h2>The Mane Attraction</h2><p>Weddings have the strangest effect on people.

Illustrated with historical photographs, The <i>Titanic Disaster Hearings</i> is a vital piece of the puzzle that has sparked worldwide fascination.</p><p></p></p><p>When Tom Kuntz, the "Word for Word" section editor of the <i>New York Times</i>, started researching a column on the Senate hearings about the <i>Titanic</i> disaster, he discovered that this supposedly public information was tough for the public to come by--it was stuck away in archives on cumbersome microfiche. The <i>Times</i> just hates anything that comes between people and information--just look at its historic efforts to publicize the government's Vietnam policy in the recent book <i>The Day the Presses Stopped: A History of the Pentagon Papers Case</i>. So Kuntz intelligently excerpted and published, for the first time ever, these transcripts, noting without fear or favor his own paper's participation in the then-common practice of checkbook journalism and presenting hundreds of pages of gripping eyewitness testimony. <i>The Titanic Disaster Hearings</i> also includes a helpful, if rather brief, index to the testimony, so you can look up "Lookout men, glasses for" and turn to the page with this heartbreaking discussion of the owners' inexplicable refusal to give the lookouts binoculars:<p> SENATOR SMITH: Suppose you had had [binoculars], could you have seen this black object [the iceberg] a greater distance?</p><p> MR. FLEET [a <i>Titanic</i> lookout]: We could have seen it a bit sooner.</p><p> SENATOR SMITH: How much sooner?</p><p> MR. FLEET: Well, enough to get out of the way...</p><p> "Here the world learned of Isidor and Ida Straus's decision to die together rather than separate under the 'women and children first' evacuation tradition," writes Kuntz. "Archibald Gracie vividly described people swarming up the <i>Titanic</i>'s rear decks as the ship plunged deeper into the sea." One does not envy the wireless operators explaining how their state-of-the-art system managed to screw up so badly, nor <i>Titanic</i> officer Pitman, who claimed his passengers and crewmen refused his order to row back to pick up screaming survivors in their boat, which had room for 20 more people, because they feared those in the water would swamp them:</p><p> SENATOR SMITH: How many of these cries were there? Was it a chorus, or was it-- </p><p> MR. PITMAN: I would rather you did not speak about that.</p><p> SENATOR SMITH: I would like to know how you were impressed by it.</p><p> MR. PITMAN: Well, I can not very well describe it. I would rather you would not speak of it.</p><p> SENATOR SMITH: I realize that it is not a pleasant theme, and yet I would like to know whether these cries were general and in chorus, or desultory and occasional?</p><p> MR. PITMAN: There was a continual moan for about an hour.</p><p> There are 32 useful pictures in the book, but its raison d'�tre is words, which Kuntz has compiled and arranged in an addictively readable fashion.</p>The fabulous remake of the film Titanic did more than launch Leonardo DiCaprio&#39;s movie career. An amazing number of audiobooks have been released on this topic, representing a wide range of perspectives. The Titanic Disaster Hearings makes for compelling listening and demonstrates the range of emotion that results when disaster strikes a large and varied body of people; sound effects add further depth to the production. The twenty-member star-studded cast gives the listener a feeling of history and a sense of what the 1912 Senate hearings were like. It&#39;s also intriguing to hear firsthand the vocabulary and manners practiced early in this century. Happily, those who aren&#39;t moviegoers may learn more about the history of the Titanic by listening to this audio presentation. S.G.B.

And yet--as architect Steve Schaecher so poignantly reveals in this collection of renderings--architects of genius from time immemorial have used their considerable talents to enhance the beauty and function of the outhouse. His extensive research has uncovered a wealth of stunning outdoor bathroom designs that say much about the history of architecture. Although Schaecher's friends and family have worried about his obsession with bathroom drawings, it is clear that with the publication of this tome, his seat in the annals of architectural history will never be put down. <p>Here are reproductions of stylish (dare we say "perfectionist"?) renderings of Thronehenge, Wright's Flushing Water, the Odor Dame Cathedral, the Taj Ma-stall, Jefferson's Johnicello, Sullivan's Merchants First National Outhouse, Le Corbusier's Bidet Savoye, Fuller's Geodesic Throne, the Hancock's John Building, the Centre Pompidoodoo-the unmistakable outhouse for that weird-looking French museum-and many others. Each is accompanied by insightful historical and analytical text, depending on your definitions of insightful and analytical. The preface, by architectural critic I.P. Daley, will leave you in no doubt of the importance of this completely nonsensical book.</p></p><p></p><h2>The Earl &amp; the Fairy, Vol. 4</h2><p>Lydia can see fairies, but can she tell who the re<br><br>Lydia Carlton is a fairy doctor,one of the few people with the ability to see the magical creatures who share our world.

Steinem admits that as a teenager she walked out on the movie Gentlemen Prefer Blondes because she was embarrassed at Monroe's performance/persona. Now admiring of her subject, Steinem spends little time on Monroe's films but instead concentrates on her personality, believing it, along with her appearance, to be responsible for her status as a cultural icon. Occasionally Steinem's prose is too purple, but for the most part the book serves well as an even-handed introduction to the Monroe phenomenon. Barris's numerous photographs are attractive but somewhat repetitious, as they apparently were taken at just a few sessions. Fortunately, some photos from additional sources are used to depict other aspects of Monroe's life. John Smothers, Monmouth Cty.

Its 16 extensively illustrated chapters consider the food traditions of New England coastal people, of cooks aboard fishing and deepwater vessels, and the celebration of Christmas, Thanksgiving, Fourth of July and the fruits of summer. Each chapter is followed by historic recipes, 185 in all, interpreted for the modern cook. Winner of the 1996 Julia Child Cookbook Award for distinguished culinary scholarship.&#34;</p><p>SANDRA L.

She has to use standard units like inches and nonstandard units like paper clips to find out height, width, length, weight, volume, temperature, and time. Lisa decides to measure her dog, Penny, and finds out ... <br><br>Penny's nose = 1 inch long <br>Penny's tail = 1 dog biscuit long<br>Penny's paw print = 3 centimeters wide <br><br>... and that's only the beginning! Lisa learns a lot about her dog and about measuring, and even has fun doing it.<br><br>This clear and engaging concept book, delivered with a sense of humor, is certain to win over the most reluctant mathematician. <br></p><p>Loreen Leedy is the author/illustrator of many children&#x2019;s books, including <i>It&#x2019;s Probably Penny</i> and <i>Mapping Penny's World</i>. Born in Wilmington, Delaware, she majored in art in college but wasn&#x2019;t sure what kind of artist she wanted to be. She started out making jewelry in the shape of pigs, cats, dragons, and other animals, and then one day she started making book characters out of her animals. She is skilled at making concepts fun and accessible to children, and often speaks at conferences and in schools throughout the United States. She lives with her husband in central Florida.Gr. 2^-4. With several successful informational picture books already to her credit, including <i>Mission Addition</i> and <i>Postcards from Pluto</i> (1993), Leedy turns her attention to a subject children frequently have difficulty understanding: measurement. In this creative introduction, she takes a look at various kinds of measurement (height, weight, volume, even time and temperature) and units of measure, presenting them as part of a scenario in which a young girl, Lisa, uses her dog, Penny, to help her complete her measuring assignment for class. Crisp, carefully captioned pictures, including many easy-to-grasp visual comparisons, spread across large-size pages, making the book easy to use with a small group. Leedy goes into the most detail about height and length, demonstrating, in the illustrations and through a chart, the relationship between inches, feet, and yards. She's more general with other measures, sticking largely to introducing units of measurement (for example, tablespoon, teaspoon, second, minute), and leaving the rest up to grown-ups to explain. One of the best parts of the book is her treatment of nonstandard units, which is both fun and informative: Penny's tail is one dog biscuit long, but it takes 10 biscuits to measure the tail of a greyhound. Leedy also introduces children to the more abstract concept of value: "We decided Penny is kind of expensive . . . but she's worth it," which adults can explain further in follow-up discussions. The book is perfect for classroom use, but it's also not much of a stretch to imagine children at home whipping out measuring devices and cornering their pets. <i>Stephanie Zvirin</i></p><h2>Men on Men 7: Best New Gay Fiction</h2><p>This extraordinary collection of gay fiction builds on the six previous volumes in the series, which is firmly established throughout the literary world as the cornerstone of America's gay literary tradition. The stories in this seventh edition are diverse, culled from the talents of established authors such as <b>Andrew Holleran, Felice Picano</b>, and <b>Allen Ellenzwaig</b>, as well as from the work of new young writers. <p>There are new themes in this seventh edition: more stories deal with the working class milieu and address class issues and insecurities; relationships between gay men and lesbian women are portrayed, as is the impact of the media on gay life; and more of these stories are unabashedly sexually explicit than in previous collections. Bergman's collection once again reflects the continuing vitality of gay literature and attests to its ability to confront the challenges of our times.</p></p><p><b>David Bergman</b> is a Professor of English at Towson State University, and is the author of <b>Gaiety Transfigured: Gay Representation in American Literature</b> and the editor of <b>Camp Grounds: Style and Homosexuality</b>. Bergman has published poetry in <b>The Paris Review, The New Criterion</b>, and <b>The New Republic</b>. He has edited a collection of Edmund White's essays entitled <b>The Burning Library</b>, and is presently working on a history of the Violet Quill group. He lives in Baltimore, Maryland.Rarely has a subtitle been so apt, or a series so consistently strong. Against the recent deluge of sloppy, would-be postmodern subcultural stories, Men on Men has regularly yielded a trove of well-wrought gay-themed short fiction. Gay critic, poet and anthologist Bergman includes among these 20 stories several by well-known authors. There's an engagingly sad piece by Andrew Holleran called "The Married Man," which traces an aging janitor's "years of celibacy" ; Felice Picano's "The Geology of Southern California at Black's Beach" is also notable. The collection's real rewards, however, are excellent stories by such new writers as Keith Banner, Shawn Behlen, C. Bard Cole, Alex Jeffers, Brian Sloan and Emanuel Xavier in which stereotypes familiar from older gay-themed fiction are overturned. There are gay men who love women, gay men who are poor and rough around the edges, even gay men who kill without being Cruising-style psychos. Some stories succeed on their own terms but gain little from a gay context. But for the most part this volume boasts maturely conceived and executed images and ideas. David Newman's "Calendar Boy" is a funny, compact take on the collegiate closet, and Greg Johnson's "The Death of Jackie Kennedy" crosscuts sensitively among the narrator's father, who's dying of cancer, the narrator's lover, who's fighting a "final bout with AIDS," and its eponymous celebrity demise.

In his late seventies, he continues to savour new experiences, including his first visit to America and his first flight in a helicopter. As always, he captures the flavour of the age, ruefully observing how the vulgar prosperity of the mid-Thatcher years has transformed Cotswold manor houses into weekend retreats for the London rich with their cocktail bars. As candid as ever, he confesses to a pang of disappointment when Bruce Chatwin, one of several friends to have developed AIDS, makes a temporary recovery.<br>Like its predecessors, this volume is a treasure-trove of gossip and anecdote. The Queen is 'rather shocked' by the unconventional sex life of Lord Esher, the favourite courtier of her great-grandfather Edward VII and subject of Lees-Milne's latest biography. Elsewhere, we learn that the flamboyantly heterosexual King Edward himself once seduced a nephew. The Prince of Wales feels the mantle of John Betjeman has fallen on his shoulders, Diana Mosley explains why Macmillan rather than Ribbentrop should have been hanged after the war, Mick Jagger displays an extensive knowledge of Shakespeare, and Alan Clark admits he is bored stiff by his life in politics.</p><p>James Lees-Milne died in 1997. Once Country Houses Secretary of the National Trust, he is now best known for his memoirs and diaries, described by Jeremy Lewis as second to none in their comicality, rueful self-knowledge and feline observations.

What distinguishes this diary is the cast. There is a good cross-section of people who had a particular social significance. James Lees-Milne was an inveterate socialiser.

Although symbols of victory for the generation that came befpre them, they are actively engaged in a new struggle&#x2014;one for their own identities. <br><br>In <i>Testimony</i>, Black students across the country express their generation's shared experiences&#x2014;from racism in school to the politics of hair. One student considers the dynamics between Black men and women as he explores his own relationships; another writes of ther decision to attend a women's college, and the importance of women role models in her development. Through their compelling poetry and prose, these student writers claim identities from fragmented lives, embrace themselves, and resurrect their spirits.</p><p>Natasha Tarplay is editor of &#34;Testimony: Young African-Americans on Identity and Self-Discovery&#34;. Her work has appeared in Essence, the Los Angeles Times, The Chicago Tribune, and The Washington Post, as well as many literary journals. She lives in Chicago, Illinois.In this collection, young black writers, primarily recent college graduates like editor Tarpley (of Harvard), offer poetry and essays on subjects personal, political and cultural. Though several are self-indulgent or pretentious, most should speak to the authors' peers. As with many young writers, especially those bearing the brunt of racism, grievances-about prejudice, inequality and ghetto pain-dominate. The topics of love, family and friends generate more nuanced pieces, including Paitra Russell's criticism of sexist black men: "I am you: black, strong, and determined, but infinitely tired." The section on education includes Toure's thoughtful account of his struggle for identity on campus: "We share a history but react individually." Hip-hop tales and debates dominate the section on art and aesthetics, unfortunately hinting that black college students don't look beyond the beat. Better are reflections like Faith Adiele's first exposure to the Jackson Five and John Frazier's thoughts on being black and gay. A final section mixes some loopiness-Cecil Gray's Afrocentric paradigms-with wiser words from Jelani Cobb Jr., on the intersection of black pop culture and politics, and Samuel Frederick Reynolds on the anti-ideological legacy of Malcolm X. <br>Copyright 1994 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Popped Culture: A Social History of Popcorn in America</h2><p>In this fascinating book, Andrew Smith, who teaches culinary history, investigates the flavorful myths surrounding popcorn s introduction, the reasons behind its unflagging popularity, &amp; its ever-increasing success through a fortuitous association with new technologies, such as radio, movies, &amp; microwaves.

The third Iran-Iraq war is over; the 11/11 dirty bomb attack on the port of Long Beach, California is receding into memory; Saudi Arabia has recently quelled a coup; Russians and Turks are clashing in the Caspian Basin; Iranian armored units, supported by the satellite and drone power of their Chinese allies, have emerged from their enclaves in Tehran and are sweeping south attempting to recapture the resource rich territory that had been stolen from them, in their view, by Lukoil, BP, and ExxonMobil and their privately-funded armies. Everywhere military force is for hire. &nbsp;Oil companies, multi-national corporations and banks employ powerful, cutting-edge mercenary armies to control global chaos and protect their riches.&nbsp; Even nation states enlist mercenary forces to suppress internal insurrections, hunt terrorists, and do the black bag jobs necessary to maintain the <i>new </i>New World Order. <br>&nbsp;<br>Force Insertion is the world's merc monopoly. Its leader is the disgraced former United States Marine General James Salter, stripped of his command by the president for nuclear saber-rattling with the Chinese and banished to the Far East.&nbsp; A grandmaster military and political strategist, Salter deftly seizes huge oil and gas fields, ultimately making himself the most powerful man in the world.&nbsp; Salter's endgame is to take vengeance on those responsible for his exile and then come home...as Commander in Chief. The only man who can stop him is the novel's narrator, Gilbert "Gent" Gentilhomme, Salter's most loyal foot soldier and as close to him as the son Salter lost. As this action-jammed, lightning fast, and brutally realistic novel builds to its heart-stopping climax Gent launches his personally and professionally most desperate mission: to take out his mentor and save the United States from self destruction.<br>&nbsp;<br>Infused by a staggering breadth of research in military tactics and steeped in the timeless themes of the honor and valor of men at war that distinguish all of Pressfield&#x2019;s fiction, <i>The Profession</i> is that rare novel that informs and challenges the reader almost as much as it entertains.</p><p><p>Steven Pressfield is the author of&nbsp;<i>Gates of Fire</i>, <i>The Legend of Bagger Vance</i>, <i>Killing Rommel</i>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<i>The War of Art</i>. &nbsp;His books are in the curriculum at West Point, Annapolis and the Naval War College, as well as being on the Commandant's Reading List for the Marine Corps.

This new book fills an important gap in the literature of the period by covering these German capital ships in detail and studying the full span of battleship development during this period. The book is arranged as a chronological narrative, with technical details, construction schedules, and ultimate fates tabulated throughout, thus avoiding the sometimes disjointed structure that can result from a class-by-class approach. Heavily illustrated with line drawings and photographs, many from German sources, the book offers readers a fresh visual look at these ships. A key objective of the book is to make available a full synthesis of the published fruits of archival research by German writers found in the pre-World War II books of Koop &amp; Schmolke, Gro�mer's on the construction program of the dreadnaught era, Forstmeier &amp; Breyer on World War I projects, and Schenk &amp; Nottelmann's papers in <i>Warship International</i>. As well as providing data not available in English-language books, these sources correct significant errors in standard English sources. <br><br></p><p>Aidan Dodson is a senior research fellow in the Department of Archaeology and Anthropology at the University of Bristol.

Barrett chronicles how a new urban American identity was forged in the streets, saloons, churches, and workplaces of the American city. This process of &#x201c;Americanization from the bottom up&#x201d; was deeply shaped by the Irish. From Lower Manhattan to the South Side of Chicago to Boston&#x2019;s North End, newer waves of immigrants and African Americans found it nearly impossible to avoid the Irish. While historians have emphasized the role of settlement houses and other mainstream institutions in Americanizing immigrants, Barrett makes the original case that the culture absorbed by newcomers upon reaching American shores had a distinctly Hibernian cast.</p><p>By 1900, there were more people of Irish descent in New York City than in Dublin; more in the United States than in all of Ireland. But in the late nineteenth century, the sources of immigration began to shift, to southern and eastern Europe and beyond. Whether these newcomers wanted to save their souls, get a drink, find a job, or just take a stroll in the neighborhood, they had to deal with entrenched Irish Americans.</p><p>Barrett reveals how the Irish vacillated between a progressive and idealistic impulse toward their fellow immigrants and a parochial defensiveness stemming from the hostility earlier generations had faced upon their own arrival in America. They imparted racist attitudes toward African Americans; they established ethnic &#x201c;deadlines&#x201d; across city neighborhoods; they drove other immigrants from docks, factories, and labor unions. Yet the social teachings of the Catholic Church, a sense of solidarity with the oppressed, and dark memories of poverty and violence in both Ireland and America ushered in a wave of progressive political activism that eventually embraced other immigrants.</p><p>Drawing on contemporary sociological studies and diaries, newspaper accounts, and Irish American literature, <i>The Irish Way </i>illustrates how the interactions between the Irish and later immigrants on the streets, on the vaudeville stage, in Catholic churches, and in workplaces helped forge a multiethnic American identity that has a profound legacy in our cities today.</p></p><p><b>James R.

Lofty ruminations ("What is there in life, after all, unless every act, every greeting, every dialogue, every cooperative effort in street and factory recognises that human life has a value and that value can be expressed in art?") are juxtaposed with exercises for the toes, arches and the like. The plodding prose meanders from discourses on why Menuhin chose the violin over piano and cello, and reflections on Mozart, Beethoven and other great composers, to what the maestro eats, wears, packs in his violin case, where he sleeps and what he considers an ideal vacation. Sprinkled throughout this slim but pricey volume are his exercises, illustrated with photos. Many are of the commonsensical stretching, breathing and relaxation variety, which are suitable for the traveling salesman as well as musician; most helpful for aspiring maestros are the series of exercises designed for the development of technique. <br>Copyright 1986 Reed Business Information, Inc.The subtitle of this disarming, endearing book describes it exactly. Menuhin shares his philosophy and preparation for performing and living in gentle, undogmatic fashion and with humor. His thoughts range from metaphysics to diet, from composers to technique, from travel to critics to self-knowledge. Interspersed are descriptions of exercises he developed for his own use as musician and violinist, copiously and clearly illustrated. While this book is addressed (though without so stating) to the young violinist, there is much for any musician here, and much for the general reader. Well and simply written, with attractive layout, though the paper and cover are of cheap quality. Highly recommended.

Visit her at SusanMallery.com.Penny Jackson knew that it was probably wrong to be so excited to see her ex-husband come crawling back, but she was willing to live with the character flaw.<br><br>"You know he's going to want to hire you," her friend Naomi said.<br><br>"Oh, yeah. The sweet smell of validation." Penny leaned back in her chair and considered the possibilities. "I want him to beg. Not in a vicious, I hate your guts way, but more as a..."<br><br>"Show of support for divorced women everywhere?" Naomi asked.<br><br>Penny laughed. "Exactly. I suppose that makes me petty and small."<br><br>"Maybe, but you're looking especially fabulous today, if that helps."<br><br>"A little." Penny smoothed the front of her loose sweater and glanced at the clock. "We're meeting for lunch downtown. A neutral location&#x2014;no memories, good or bad."<br><br>"Stay away from the good ones," Naomi warned her. "You always were a sucker where Cal was concerned."<br><br>"That was so three years ago. I'm completely over him. I've moved on."<br><br>"Right." Naomi didn't look convinced. "Don't think about how great he looks in his clothes, or out of them. Instead remember how he broke your heart, lied about wanting children and trampled your fragile dreams."<br><br>Easy enough, Penny thought, a flicker of annoyance muscling in on her good mood.<br><br>Nearly as bad, four years ago she'd applied for a job as a cook in Buchanan's, one of Cal's family's restaurants. The job had been strictly entry-level&#x2014;she would have been in charge of salads. There had been ten other applicants. Worried she wouldn't make the cut, Penny had asked her then-husband to put in a good word for her with his grandmother. He'd refused and she hadn't gotten the job.<br><br>"This time the job is coming to me," Penny said. "I intend to take advantage of that. And him. In a strictly business way, of course."<br><br>"Of course," Naomi echoed, not sounding the least bit convinced. "He's trouble for you. Always has been. Be careful."<br><br>Penny stood and reached for her purse. "When am I not?"<br><br>"Ask for lots of money."<br><br>"I promise."<br><br>"Don't think about having sex with him." Penny laughed. "Oh, please. That isn't an issue.<br><br>You'll see."<br><br>Penny arrived early, then stayed in her car until five minutes after the appointed time. A small, possibly insignificant power play on her part, but she figured she'd earned it.<br><br>She walked into the quiet leather-and-linen bistro. Before she could approach the hostess, she saw Cal standing by a booth in the back. They might have friends in common, and live in the same city, but since she'd done her darnedest to avoid close proximity to him they never ran into each other. This lunch was going to change that.<br><br>"Hi," she said with a breezy smile.<br><br>"Penny." He looked her over, then motioned to the other side of the booth. "Thanks for joining me."<br><br>"How could I refuse? You wouldn't say much over the phone, which made me curious." She slid onto the seat.<br><br>Cal looked good. Tall, muscled, the same soulful eyes she remembered. Just sitting across from him caused her body to remember what it had been like back when things had been good and they'd been unable to keep their hands off each other. Not that she was interested in him in that way. She'd learned her lesson.<br><br>Plus, she couldn't forgive the fact that in the three years they'd been apart, he hadn't had the common courtesy to get fat or wrinkled. Nope, he was gorgeous&#x2014;which was just like a man.<br><br>Still, he needed her help. Oh, yeah, that part was very cool. While they'd been married the message had been she wasn't good enough. Now he wanted her to save the day...or the restaurant, in this case. While she planned to say yes, eventually, she was going to enjoy every second of making him beg.<br><br>"The Waterfront is in trouble," he said, then paused as the waitress came by to take their order.<br><br>When the woman left, Penny leaned back in the tufted seat of the booth and smiled. "I'd heard it was more than in trouble. I'd heard the place was done for. Hemorrhaging customers and money."<br><br>She blinked, going for an innocent expression. No doubt Cal would see through her attempt and want to strangle her. But he couldn't. Because he <em>needed</em> her. Was, in fact, desperate for her help. How she loved that in a man. Especially in Cal.<br><br>"Things have been better," he admitted, looking as if he hated every second of the conversation.<br><br>"The Waterfront is the oldest restaurant in the infamous Buchanan dynasty," she said cheerfully. "The flagship. Or it used to be. Now you have a reputation for bad food and worse service." She sipped her water. "At least that's the word on the street."<br><br>"Thanks for the update."<br><br>His jaw tightened as he spoke. She could tell he was furious about this meeting. She had an idea of what he was thinking&#x2014;of all the chefs in all of Seattle, why did it have to be her?<br><br>She didn't know either, but sometimes a girl couldn't help catching a break.<br><br>"Your contract is up," he said.<br><br>She smiled. "Yes, it is."<br><br>"You're looking for a new position."<br><br>"Yes, I am."<br><br>"I'd like to hire you."<br><br>Five little words. Words that weren't significant on their own, but when joined together, could mean the world to someone. In this case, her.<br><br>"I've had other offers," Penny said calmly.<br><br>"Have you accepted any of them?"<br><br>"Not yet."<br><br>Cal was tall, about six-three, with dark hair. His face was all sculpted cheekbones and stubborn jaw, and his mouth frequently betrayed his mood. Right now it was thin and straight. He was so angry, he practically spouted steam. She'd never felt better.<br><br>"I'm here to offer you a five-year contract. You get complete control of the kitchen, the standard agreement." He named a salary that made her blink.<br><br>Penny took another sip of her water. In truth she didn't want just another job. She wanted her own place. But opening a restaurant took serious money, which she didn't have. Her choices were to take on more partners than she wanted or wait. She'd decided to wait.<br><br>Her plan was to spend the next three years putting away money, then open the restaurant of her dreams. So while a big salary was nice, it wasn't enough.<br><br>"Not interested," she said, with a slight smile.<br><br>Cal's gaze narrowed. "What do you want? Aside from my head on a stick."<br><br>Her smile turned genuine. "I've never wanted that," she told him. "Well, not after the divorce was final. It's been three years, Cal. I've long since moved on. Haven't you?"<br><br>"Of course. Then why aren't you interested? It's a good job."<br><br>"I'm not looking for a job. I want an opportunity."<br><br>"Meaning?"<br><br>"More than the standard agreement. I want my name out front and complete creative control in back." She reached into the pocket of her jacket and pulled out a folded piece of paper. "I have a list."<br><br>Doing the right thing had always been a pain in the ass, Cal thought as he took the sheet and unfolded it. This time was no different.<br><br>He scanned the list, then tossed it back to her. Penny didn't want an opportunity, she wanted his balls sauteed with garlic and a nice cream sauce.<br><br>"No," he said flatly, ignoring the way the afternoon sunlight brought out the different colors of red and brown in her auburn hair.<br><br>"Fine by me." She picked up the sheet and started to slide out of the booth. "Nice to see you, Cal. Good luck with the restaurant."<br><br>He reached across the table and grabbed her wrist.<br><br>"Wait."<br><br>"But if we have nothing to talk about."<br><br>She looked innocent enough, he thought as he gazed into her big blue eyes, but he knew better than to believe the wide-eyed stare.<br><br>Penny could be convinced to take the job; otherwise she wouldn't have bothered with a meeting. Playing him for a fool wasn't her style. But that didn't mean she wouldn't enjoy making him beg.<br><br>Given their past, he supposed he'd earned it. So he would bargain with her, giving in where he had to.<br><br>He would even have enjoyed the negotiation if only she didn't look so damn smug.<br><br>He rubbed his thumb across her wrist bone, knowing she would hate that. She'd always lamented her large forearms, wrists and hands, claiming they were out of proportion with the rest of her body. He'd thought she was crazy to obsess about a flaw that didn't exist. Besides, she had chef's hands&#x2014;scarred, nimble and strong. He'd always liked her hands, whether they were working on food in the kitchen or working on him in the bedroom.<br><br>"Not going to happen," he said, nodding his head at the paper and releasing his hold on her. "You know that, too. So where's the real list?"<br><br>She grinned and eased back into the booth. "I heard you were desperate. I had to try."<br><br>"Not that desperate. What do you want?"<br><br>"Creative freedom on the menus, complete control over the back half of the store, my name on the menu, ownership of any specialty items I create, the right to refuse any general manager you try to stuff down my throat, four weeks vacation a year and ten percent of the profits."<br><br>The waitress appeared with their lunches. He'd ordered a burger, Penny a salad. But not just any salad. Their server laid out eight plates with various ingredients in front of Penny's bowl of four kinds of lettuce.<br><br>As he watched, she put olive oil, balsamic vinaigrette and ground pepper into a coffee cup, then squeezed in half a lemon. After whisking them with her fork, she dumped the diced, smoked chicken and feta onto her salad, then sniffed the candied pecans before adding them. She passed over walnuts, took only half of the tomato, added red onions instead of green and then put on her dressing. After tossing everything, she stacked the plates and took her first bite of lunch.<br><br>"How is it?" he asked.<br><br>"Good."<br><br>"Why do you bother eating out?"<br><br>"I don't usually."<br><br>She hadn't before, either. She'd been content to whip up something incredible in their kitchen and he'd been happy to let her.<br><br>He returned his attention to her demands. He wouldn't give her everything she wanted on general principle. Plus it was just plain bad business.<br><br>"You can have creative control over the menus and the back half of the store," he said. "Specialty items stay with the house."<br><br>Anything a chef created while in the employ of a restaurant was owned by that restaurant.<br><br>"I want to be able to take them with me when I go." She forked a piece of lettuce. "It's a deal-breaker, Cal."<br><br>"You'll come up with something new there."<br><br>"The point is I don't want to create something wonderful and leave it in your family's less than capable hands." She glanced at him. "Before you get all defensive, let me point out that five years ago, The Waterfront had a waiting list every single weekend."<br><br>"You can have your name on the menu," he said. "As executive chef."<br><br>He saw her stiffen. She'd never had that title before. It would mean something now.<br><br>"And three percent of the profits," he added.<br><br>"Eight."<br><br>"Four."<br><br>"Six."<br><br>"Five," he said. "But you don't get a say in the general manager."<br><br>"I have to work with him or her."<br><br>"And he or she has to work with you."<br><br>She grinned. "But I have a reputation of being nothing but sunshine and light in the workplace. You know that."<br><br>He'd heard she was a perfectionist and relentless in her quest for quality. She had also been called difficult, annoying and just plain brilliant.<br><br>"You can't dictate the GM," he said. "He's already been hired. At least in the short term."<br><br>She wrinkled her nose. "Who is it?"<br><br>"You'll find out later. Besides, the first guy's just coming in to do cleanup. Someone else will be hired in a few months. You can have a say on him or her."<br><br>Her eyebrows rose. "Interesting. A gunslinger coming in to clean up the town. I think I like that." She drew in a breath. "How about five percent of the profits, a three-year deal, I get some say in the next GM and I take my specialty items with me." She held up her hand. "But only to my own place and you can keep them on The Waterfront menu as well."<br><br>He wasn't surprised she wanted to branch out on her own. Most good chefs did. Few had the capital or the management skills.<br><br>"Oh, and that salary you offered me before was fine," she said.<br><br>"Of course it was," he told her. "That assumed you didn't get this other stuff. How many are you bringing with you?"<br><br>"Two. My sous-chef and my assistant."<br><br>Chefs usually came with a small staff. As long as they worked well with the others in the kitchen, Cal didn't care.<br><br>"You'll never take the vacation," he said. At least she never had before.<br><br>"I want it," she said. "Just so we're clear, I <em>will</em> be using it."<br><br>He shrugged. "Not until we're up and running."<br><br>"I was thinking late summer. I'll have everything together by then."<br><br>Maybe. She hadn't seen the mess yet.<br><br>"Is that it?" he asked.<br><br>She considered for a second, then shrugged. "Get me the offer in writing. I'll look it over and then let you know if we have a deal."<br><br>"You'd never get this much anywhere else. Don't pretend you'll back out."<br><br>The smugness returned. "You never know, Cal. I want to hear what your competition puts on the table."<br><br>"I know who's interested. They'll never cut you in for that much of the profit."<br><br>"True enough, but their restaurants are successful. A smaller percentage of something is better than a big chunk of nothing."<br><br>"This could make you a star," he said. "People would notice."<br><br>"People already notice."<br><br>He wanted to tell her she wasn't all that special. That he could name five chefs who would do as good a job. The problem was he couldn't. In the past three years, Penny had made a name for herself. He needed that to dig The Waterfront out of its hole.<br><br>"I'll have the agreement couriered over to your place tomorrow afternoon," he said.<br><br>She practically purred her contentment. "Good."<br><br>"You're enjoying this, aren't you?"<br><br>"Oh, yeah. I won't even mind working for you because every time you piss me off, I'm going to remind you that you came looking for me. That you <em>needed</em> me."<br><br>Revenge. He respected that. It annoyed him, but he respected it.<br><br>"Why are you doing this?" she asked as she picked up a pecan. "You got out of the family business years ago."<br><br>Back when they'd been married, he thought. He'd escaped, only to be dragged in again.<br><br>"Someone had to save the sinking ship," he said.<br><br>"Yes, but why you? You don't care about the family empire."<br><br>He threw twenty dollars on the table and slid out of the booth. "I'll need your answer within twenty-four hours of you getting the contract."<br><br>"You'll have it the following morning."</p><h2>The Chilling Deception (Guinevere Jones, Book 2)</h2><p>Guinevere Jones and her partner, Zac Justis, are hired to protect businessman Edward Vandyke as he conveys valuable papers to the secluded San Juan islands, and find themselves caught in a web of treachery, revenge, and murder</p><p>Jayne Castle, the author of The Lost Night, Canyons of Night, Midnight Crystal, Obsidian Prey, Dark Light, Silver Master, Ghost Hunter, After Glow, and After Dark, is a pseudonym for Jayne Ann Krentz, the author of more than fifty New York Times bestsellers.

All young kids are oblivious at first&#x2014;public tantrums and soiling one&#x2019;s pants are somehow okay in infancy&#x2014;but eventually most children start noticing and mimicking cultural norms. I, on the other hand, managed to glide through childhood without perceiving (or perhaps caring about) these &#x201c;accepted behaviors.&#x201d; To be clear, my mother tells me I stopped pooping my pants at a very early age, but she also told me not to use any form of the word poop in my book. Anyway, I just never seemed to care much about what other people were doing.<br> <br>I was a natural-born drama queen, and my kindergarten classroom set the stage for one of my earliest impromptu performances. One morning as I was getting dressed for school I found myself digging through boxes of dress-up clothes instead of my dresser. And to think, all this time I&#x2019;d been limiting the use of costumes to playdates and Halloween&#x2014;what a waste!<br> <br>Minutes later, I emerged from my room wearing a kimono, red sequined shoes, a single glove, and a curly brown wig. Had the wig been red I would have been overjoyed&#x2014;Little Orphan Annie was one of my first idols&#x2014;but this wig would do. It had short, uneven ringlets, and if I shifted my weight just so, I could make the frizzy curls dance around my face. The cute outfit my mother had purchased for the first day of school lay in a heap on my bedroom floor.

Maybe their tall-girl instincts told them I needed looking after, or maybe I subconsciously gravitated to their protective body types; either way, we made a wicked team.<br> <br>Here we are on a field trip to the petting zoo, Krista and Naomi mean muggin&#x2019; the camera in my defense.<br> <br><br> <br>On second thought, maybe it was our mutual love for saggy denim that brought us together.<br> <br>Krista and Naomi&#x2019;s parents were also best friends, so they were constantly doing things together outside of school. After a few months of playing with them at recess, the girls brought me into their inner circle of friendship by inviting me to Knott&#x2019;s Berry Farm. When Naomi asked me if I wanted to go with her I was speechless. Going to Knott&#x2019;s Berry Farm was considered a full-fledged vacation for my family. Apparently, to hers it was an average weekend activity, one to which she could invite friends no less!<br> <br>When Naomi&#x2019;s mom called that night I could hear my mom in the next room.<br> <br>&#x201c;Hi Clair, I was just thinking we needed to invite Naomi over again soon.&#x201d;<br> <br>There was a pause.<br> <br>&#x201c;Oh, are you sure? Okay.&#x201d; My mom continued, &#x201c;Thank you, she is going to be so excited.&#x201d;<br> <br>And just like that it was settled.<br> <br>On the morning of our outing I slipped into my best saggy jeans and waited anxiously for my ride by the front door. As I sat looking out the window my mom watched from the kitchen.<br> <br>&#x201c;Lindsey, are you excited to go to Knott&#x2019;s Berry Farm?&#x201d; she asked.<br> <br>&#x201c;Yes,&#x201d; I said smiling, eagerly looking for Naomi&#x2019;s red SUV.<br> <br>&#x201c;I want you to tell me about all the rides when you get back. Maybe another time we&#x2019;ll go together.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Okay,&#x201d; I replied, my focus unwavering.<br> <br>My mom, like most, wanted to give her kids everything and more. But she was also the kind of mom who never spent money she didn&#x2019;t have. If we ran out of milk before the end of the month, we ate Cream of Wheat instead of cereal; and when we ate a lot of Cream of Wheat, we didn&#x2019;t go places like the local Blockbuster, let alone Knott&#x2019;s Berry Farm.<br> <br>&#x201c;Hey Lindsey, look at me for a second.&#x201d;<br> <br>Reluctantly, I turned toward my mom. She was smiling gently.<br> <br>&#x201c;You know I love you, right?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Yep,&#x201d; I said quickly, but I was immediately distracted by the slow crunch of tires pulling into the driveway.<br> <br>&#x201c;She&#x2019;s here!&#x201d; I screamed, jumping up and running for the door.<br> <br>&#x201c;All right, have fun!&#x201d; she yelled back, scrubbing a pan in the sink.<br> <br>Soon after arriving at the amusement park, we realized I wasn&#x2019;t tall enough for the most exciting rides. I frequently got left behind with Naomi&#x2019;s younger brother, Troy. At first I was disappointed&#x2014;how was I going to tell my mom about the rides if I couldn&#x2019;t even get on them? But eventually Naomi&#x2019;s mom started buying Troy and me special treats to keep us occupied. All I had to do was look at something for longer than six seconds and she would offer to buy it: cotton candy, churros, frozen lemonade, fry bread, and endless turns at the ring toss booth. The wonders of concession stand food were new to me. Usually, when we went out, my mom packed sandwiches that became soggy in her purse by lunchtime. Naomi&#x2019;s mom had obviously forgotten to make lunches, which was okay, since she seemed to have an endless supply of five-dollar bills to fill their place.<br> <br>At one point, Naomi&#x2019;s mom suggested that the girls go on a smaller ride with Troy and me. Naomi looked back and forth between her mother and Krista before she replied, &#x201c;But those rides are boring.&#x201d; I waited for Naomi&#x2019;s mom to pull her daughter aside to have a chat about being polite and, I don&#x2019;t know, a good friend. Instead, she handed me another five-dollar bill and let the girls go on their way.<br> <br>Before long I was stuffed, but the more I ate, the more I wanted. There was no telling when I would get another opportunity to have so much processed food and sugar, or win such ugly (but giant!) stuffed animals again. So I kept looking, and eating, and playing the ring toss. When I returned home at the end of the day I felt sick. But I was delighted by the hideous stuffed lizard under my arm. So what if I&#x2019;d spent the entire day with a four-year-old boy?<br> <br>Over time Krista and Naomi introduced me to other things: the Miss America Pageant, eating at restaurants for no particular reason, and the idea of getting paid for doing chores. They called that one &#x201c;allowance,&#x201d; and they were both shocked to hear I had never received one.<br> <br>&#x201c;What do you mean you don&#x2019;t get paid to clean your room?&#x201d;<br> <br>I was also surprised to find out that a different tooth fairy visits rich people. One time Naomi received five dollars for a front tooth. One tooth! It wasn&#x2019;t even that big. In fact, Naomi had tiny teeth&#x2014;the kind of teeth that barely reached the cob when she ate corn. I, on the other hand, had beaver cleavers, and I was certain they were going to work in my favor. The next time I lost a tooth I asked Naomi if she would put it under her pillow, which she did, and I eagerly awaited my grand prize. Her fairy was going to be so impressed. The next day she returned with the tooth but no cash. Her fairy didn&#x2019;t buy it. Disappointed, I put it under my pillow and awoke the next morning to find two shiny quarters in its place. I imagined my little fairy carrying those quarters through the night, one under each arm (which would have been much harder to fly with than a five-dollar bill), and I was grateful for her extra effort&#x2014;even if the amount of money was a letdown. At breakfast that morning my mom handed me a bowl of Cream of Wheat and sat down at the table.<br> <br>&#x201c;So, did the tooth fairy come last night?&#x201d; she asked.<br> <br>I considered telling her about Naomi&#x2019;s five dollars, but I was worried she might call the Tooth Fairy Office to complain, and what if my fairy got fired? I kept it to myself and answered, &#x201c;Yes, I got two quarters.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Two whole quarters? That must have been one big tooth!&#x201d;<br> <br>Tell that to Naomi&#x2019;s fairy, I thought. But the more I thought about it, the more I appreciated my fairy&#x2019;s quarters. She wasn&#x2019;t the richest, obviously, but she was definitely one of the strongest. I liked my little fairy, she did good.</p><h2>Creating Animated Cartoons with Character: A Guide to Developing and Producing Your Own Series for TV, the Web, and Short Film</h2><p>From the Emmy Award-winning creator of <i>Rocko's Modern Life</i> and <i>Camp Lazlo</i> comes <i>Creating Animated Cartoons with Character</i>, a comprehensive, fully illustrated guide to creating and producing a successful animated series for television, short film, and the Web.&nbsp; Joe Murray offers his substantial wisdom and expertise &#x2013; honed from more than twenty years in the business &#x2013; in creating and producing characters adn stories in an authoritative yet conversational narrative that answers such questions as:&nbsp;How do you create good characters?&nbsp; How do you conceive the world they inhabit and tell their stories?&nbsp; And once you've breathed life into your ideas, how do you successfully pitch your series to a network?<br>This book won't tell you what characters to create or how to draw them.

He knew what it looked like to seduce, to intimidate, to wheedle, and to console; to strike a pose or preach a sermon; to shake a fist or uncover a breast; how to sin and how to atone; how to commit murder and how to commit suicide. No artist had ever been so fascinated by the fashioning of personae, beginning with his own. No painter ever looked with such unsparing intelligence or such bottomless compassion at our entrances and our exits and the whole rowdy show in between.<br><br>More than three centuries after his death, Rembrandt remains the most deeply loved of all the great masters of painting, his face so familiar to us from the self-portraits painted at every stage in his life, yet still so mysterious. As with Shakespeare, the facts of his life are hard to come by; the Leiden miller's son who briefly found fame in Amsterdam, whose genius was fitfully recognized by his contemporaries, who fell into bankruptcy and died in poverty. So there is probably no other painter whose life has engendered more legends, nor to whom more unlikely pictures have been attributed (a process now undergoing rigorous reversal). <i>Rembrandt's Eyes,</i> about which Simon Schama has been thinking for more than twenty years, shows that the true biography of Rembrandt is to be discovered in his pictures. Though a succession of superbly incisive descriptions and interpretations of Rembrandt's paintings threaded into his narrative, he allows us to see Rembrandt's life clearly and to think about it afresh.<br><br>But this book moves far beyond the bounds of conventional biography or art history. With extraordinary imaginative sympathy, Schama conjures up the world in which Rembrandt moved -- its sounds, smells and tastes as well as its politics; the influences on him of the wars of the Protestant United Provinces against Spain, of the extreme Calvinism of his native Leiden, of the demands of patrons and the ambitions of contemporaries; the importance of his beloved Saskia and, after her death (Rembrandt was later forced to sell her grave, so complete was his ruin), of his mistress Hendrickje Stoffels; and, above all, the profound effect on him of the great master of the immediately preceding generation, the Catholic painter from Antwerp, Peter Paul Rubens: "the prince of painters and the painter of princes" with whom Rembrandt was obsessed for the first part of his life, and whose career was the shaping force that drove Rembrandt to test the farthest reaches of his own originality.<br><br><i>Rembrandt's Eyes</i> shows us <i>why</i> Rembrandt is such a thrilling painter, so revolutionary in his art, so penetrating of the hearts of those who have looked for three hundred years at his pictures. Above all, Schama's understanding of Rembrandt's mind and the dynamic of his life allows him to re-create Rembrandt's life on the page. Through a combination of scholarship and literary skill, Schama allows us to actually see that life through Rembrandt's own eyes. In overcoming the paucity of conventional historical evidence, it is the most intelligently true biography of Rembrandt that has ever been written, and the most dazzling achievement to date of the art historian whose work has been hailed as "marvelously rich and eloquent" ... "rare, imaginative" ... "provocative" ... "astoundingly learned with verve, humor, and an unflagging sense of delight" ... that of "a master storyteller ... and a master of history."*<br>Quotes from the <i>New York Times Book Review, Time,</i> the <i>New York Times, The Independent on Sunday,</i> and&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Nature,</i> respectively.<br><i>From the Hardcover edition.</i></p><p>The great 17th-century Dutch artist Rembrandt van Rijn left us so many arresting self-portraits, painted at every stage in his eventful life, that his distinctive face and bearing are a familiar part of the 20th-century cultural landscape, a recognizable presence in galleries across Europe and North America. Nonetheless, the artist himself remains an enigma. Rembrandt was a notoriously difficult man and an inveterate risk taker in life and art: his aspirations to a grandiose Amsterdam lifestyle in the heyday of his popularity as a painter of portraits and large-scale historical works bankrupted him, and he died in relative poverty. His personal effects and treasured collection of paintings and natural rarities were sold off and dispersed, leaving the historian with a tantalizingly scant body of fragmentary records around which to build a convincing biography. <p> In <i>Rembrandt's Eyes</i>, Simon Schama--the leading historical craftsman of our era, with a career-long commitment to Dutch history--succeeds with consummate skill in bringing the heroic painter of such masterpieces as <i>The Night Watch</i> and <i>Portrait of Jan Six</i> vividly to life. Returning to the bustling Dutch world with which he first made his reputation in the bestselling <i>Embarrassment of Riches</i> (1987), Schama re-creates Rembrandt's life and times with all the verve and panache of a historical novelist--while never for an instant losing his scrupulous grip on recorded fact and detail. The telling surviving fragments of archival information about Rembrandt's personal and professional history are skillfully embedded in a rich, dense tapestry of the commercial whirl and political hurly-burly of the 17th-century Low Countries--a divided territory, split between the Catholic and Protestant faiths and the contested powers of the Spanish Hapsburgs and the Dutch Republic--with the tentacles of the tale reaching into the most unexpected shadowy corners of European love and war, aspiration and intrigue.</p><p> <i>Rembrandt's Eyes</i> is, in fact, two biographies for the price of one. From the outset, Schama contrasts the life of Rembrandt with that of his older, equally talented countryman Peter Paul Rubens, whose meteoric rise and sustained success as a society painter forms a revealing contrast with Rembrandt's unhappier relationship with fame and fortune. The comparison is a telling one. Where Rubens furnishes the wealthy and powerful with glorious reflections of, and visual foils for, their social and political aspirations and glory, Rembrandt can never resist testing the envelope of taste and stylistic acceptability. His challenge to his clients to embrace the shock of his painterly experiments with technique, texture, and composition ultimately produced his downfall. The Amsterdam town council took down his <i>The Oath-swearing of Claudius Civilis</i>, rolled it up, and returned his masterpiece to him to be cut down in an attempt to sell it to a suitable buyer.</p><p> This is a gorgeous book to own, too. <i>Rembrandt's Eyes</i> is printed on heavy, high-gloss paper and lavishly illustrated throughout in full color. The double-page color spreads of the most memorable of Rembrandt's works will take readers' breath away. But above all, this is narrative history at its very best, a page-turner and an adventure story that will make the reader laugh and cry by turns in the time-honored tradition of masterly writing. <i>--Lisa Jardine</i></p>Simon Schama was born in London and since 1966 has taught history at Cambridge, Oxford and Harvard universities. He is now Old Dominion Professor of the Humanities in the departments of art history and history at Columbia University. He is the prize-winning author of several works, including The Embarrassment of Riches,&nbsp;&nbsp;Dead Certainties and Landscape and Memory. He lives outside New York with his wife and two children.<br><i>From the Hardcover edition.</i></p><h2>Schooled</h2><p>CAP was beginning to rile me. &#34;Of course it&#39;s empty.

He and his wife, Lynne, have three children and live in California.My Name is Constance <p>When her mother named her Constance, she had no intention of ever calling her Connie. Her mother once explained to her that Constance was a solid name, a name with substance and dignity, but "Connie" well, "Connie" was just fluff. </p><p>A lot of young girls growing up in her neighborhood would have welcomed a friendly, "Hi Connie" from her friends at school, or, at the very least, would have acknowledged the greeting with a smile. Not Constance. She corrected them resolutely. "My name is Constance." She would say, looking and sounding a bit life a stuffy old librarian with an attitude problem. "I am not a Connie." </p><p>She had that right. She was not then nor did she ever plan to be a "Connie." </p><p>It is possible to be obedient to a fault, Constance was. It never occurred to her that anything her parents ever said was not absolute truth. No advice, counsel, instruction, or observation made by her parents was ever challenged. She tried in every way to be her mother in miniature. This remarkable devotion was an enormous source of pride for her parents, through Constance never knew it. All she knew was that her parents were never wrong. </p><p>That wasn&#x2019;t true of course. They were wrong on just about everything that had anyting to do with raising healthy, well-adjusted children, they didn&#x2019;t teach their only child how to think or dream or feel or question or wonder or choose or discover anything for herself. They believed it was their job as parents to do all that for her &#x2013; and she let them. </p><p>You&#x2019;d have expected things to change when Constance turned fourteen. That was the year her parents assured her that her mother&#x2019;s illness was only temporary. But that was a lie. Constance watched her mother stoically refuse to accept the truth about her condition &#x2013; and the truth was, she was dying. </p><p>Typically when families receive such news, there&#x2019;s an initial period of denial and anger and heartbreak, followed by a sincere search for tender ways to express deep feelings and say good-bye. But Constance received only her parents&#x2019; reassurance that everything was find and that recovery was just around the corner. In fact, the only thing that even came close to resembling tenderness during that time was something Constance overheard her mother say about the nurse who helped Dr. Burton. She mentioned to her husband one evening that the nurse seemed to be a rather competent woman. It was the nearest thing to a complement Constance had ever heard her mother give. And so it&#x2019;s probably no surprise that a few years after her mother&#x2019;s death, Constance went into nursing. </p><p>To fully appreciate what happened to Constance last Christmas, you need to know that she had been a nurse at the Fullerton Hospital her entire career. Although she could never be accused of being overly compassionate, she had never shirked her duties or failed to follow a doctor&#x2019;s order to the letter. And she had never, ever questioned or challenged anyone in authority at the hospital. Needless to say, doctors loved her &#x2013; and patients didn&#x2019;t. </p><p>It was this absolute commitment to following the voice of authority that placed Constance in an extremely awkward position a few weeks before Christmas a year ago. The chief administrator of the hospital called her into his office with a special request ...</p></p><h2>The Sages: The World and Wisdom of the Rabbi&#39;s of the Talmud</h2><p>Traces the history of specific Jewish beliefs and concepts, including belief in one God, man, providence, written law, the Commandments, and redemption</p><p>Text: English, Hebrew (translation)When Professor Urbach wrote his monumental work <i>Chazal</i> nineteen years ago, it was greeted with universal acclaim...This new paperback edition will go even further to extend its readership and is sure to bring satisfaction to all who encounter it...This is a <i>magnum opus</i> by any standards...It is without equal in the English speaking world as a book to provide so complete and clear an insight into the talmudic mind which cannot but deepen one's respect for and commitment to the values for which they stood.

E. R�LVAAG, <i>GIANTS IN THE EARTH</i><p></p><p>1</p><p><i>Twelve Sleep County, Wyoming</i></p><p>WHEN RANCH OWNER OPAL SCARLETT VANISHED, NO one mourned except her three grown sons, Arlen, Hank, and Wyatt, who expressed their loss by getting into a fight with shovels.</p><p>Wyoming game warden Joe Pickett almost didn&#x2019;t hear the call over his radio when it came over the mutual-aid channel. He was driving west on Bighorn Road, having picked up his fourteen-year-old daughter, Sheridan, and her best friend, Julie, after track practice to take them home. Sheridan and Julie were talking a mile a minute, gesticulating, making his dog, Maxine, flinch with their flying arms as they talked. Julie lived on the Thunderhead Ranch, which was much farther out of town than the Picketts&#x2019; home.</p><p>Joe caught snippets of their conversation while he drove, his attention on his radio and the wounded hum of the engine and the dancing gauges on the dash. Joe didn&#x2019;t yet trust the truck, a vehicle recently assigned to him. The check-engine light would flash on and off, and occasionally there was a knocking sound under the hood that sounded like popcorn popping. The truck had been issued to him as revenge by his cost-conscious superiors, after his last vehicle had burned up in a fire in Jackson Hole. Even though the suspension was shot, the truck did have a CD player, a rarity in state vehicles, and the sound track for the ride home had been a CD Sheridan had made for him. It was titled &#x201c;Get with it, Dad&#x201d; in a black felt marker. She&#x2019;d given it to him two days before after breakfast, saying, &#x201c;You need to listen to this new music so you don&#x2019;t seem so clueless. It may help.&#x201d; Things were changing in his family. His girls were getting older. Joe was not only under the thumb of his superiors but was apparently becoming clueless too. His red uniform shirt with the pronghorn antelope Game and Fish patch on the shoulder and his green Filson vest were caked with mud from changing a tire on the mountain earlier in the day.</p><p>&#x201c;I think Jarrod Haynes likes you,&#x201d; Julie said to Sheridan.</p><p>&#x201c;Get out! Why do you say that? You&#x2019;re crazy.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Didn&#x2019;t you see him watching us practice?&#x201d; Julie asked. &#x201c;He stayed after the boys were done and watched us run.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I saw him,&#x201d; Sheridan said. &#x201c;But why do you think he likes <i>me</i>?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c; &#x2019;Cause he didn&#x2019;t take his eyes off of you the whole time, that&#x2019;s why. Even when he got a call on his cell, he stood there and watched you while he talked. He&#x2019;s hot for you, Sherry.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I wish <i>I</i> had a cell phone,&#x201d; Sheridan said.</p><p>Joe tuned out. He didn&#x2019;t want to hear about a boy targeting his daughter. It made him uncomfortable. And the cell-phone conversation made him tired. He and Marybeth had said Sheridan wouldn&#x2019;t get one until she was sixteen, but that didn&#x2019;t stop his daughter from coming up with reasons why she needed one now.</p><p>In the particularly intense way of teenage girls, Sheridan and Julie were inseparable. Julie was tall, lithe, tanned, blond, blue-eyed, and budding. Sheridan was a shorter version of Julie, but with her mother&#x2019;s startling green eyes. The two had ridden the school bus together for years and Sheridan had hated Julie, said she was bossy and arrogant and acted like royalty. Then something happened, and the two girls could barely be apart from each other. Three-hour phone calls between them weren&#x2019;t unusual at night.</p><p>&#x201c;I just don&#x2019;t know what to think about that,&#x201d; Sheridan said.</p><p>&#x201c;You&#x2019;ll be the envy of everyone if you go with him,&#x201d; Julie said.</p><p>&#x201c;He doesn&#x2019;t seem very smart.&#x201d;</p><p>Julie laughed and rolled her eyes. &#x201c;Who cares?&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;He&#x2019;s fricking awesome.&#x201d;</p><p>Joe cringed, wishing he had missed that.</p><p>He had spent the morning patrolling the brushy foothills where the spring wild turkey season was still open, although there appeared to be no turkey hunters about. It was his first foray into the timbered southwestern saddle slopes since winter. The snow was receding up the mountain, leaving hard-packed grainy drifts in arroyos and cuts. The retreating snow also revealed the aftermath of small battles and tragedies no one had witnessed that had taken place over the winter&#x2014;six mule deer that had died of starvation in a wooded hollow; a cow and calf elk that had broken through the ice on a pond and frozen in place; pronghorn antelope caught in the barbed wire of a fence, their emaciated bodies draping over the wire like rugs hanging to dry. But there were signs of renewal as well, as thick light-green shoots bristled through dead matted grass near stream sides, and fat, pregnant does stared at his passing pickup from shadowed groves.</p><p>April was the slowest month of the year in the field for a game warden, especially in a place with a fleeting spring. It was the fifth year of a drought. The hottest issue he had to contend with was what to do with the four elk that had shown up in the town of Saddlestring and seemed to have no plans to leave. While mule deer were common in the parks and gardens, elk were not. Joe had chased the four animals&#x2014;two bulls, a cow, and a calf&#x2014;from the city park several times by firing .22 blanks into the air several times. But they kept coming back. The animals had become such a fixture in the park they were now referred to as the &#x201c;Town Elk,&#x201d; and locals were feeding them, which kept them hanging around while providing empty nourishment that would eventually make them sick and kill them. Joe was loath to destroy the elk, but thought he may not have a choice if they stuck around.</p><p>The changes in his agency had begun with the election of a new governor. On the day after the election, Joe had received a four-word message from his supervisor, Trey Crump, that read: &#x201c;Hell has frozen over,&#x201d; meaning a Democrat had been elected. His name was Spencer Rulon. Within a week, the agency director resigned before being fired, and a bitter campaign was waged for a replacement. Joe, and most of the game wardens, actively supported an &#x201c;Anybody but Randy Pope&#x201d; ticket, since Pope had risen to prominence within the agency from the administrative side (rather...</p></p><h2>15-Minute Low-Carb Recipes: Instant Recipes for Dinners, Desserts, and More</h2><p>A new book by the author of 500 Low-Carb Recipes introduces readers to the joys of low-carb, high-taste eating with more than two hundred recipes for everything from Chicken and Broccoli Alfredo to Mocha Mousse.

Along the way, she takes on subjects as varied as varied as the hazards of allowing death row convicts a last smoke, an imaginary exchange with Donald Rumsfeld&#x2019; younger brother, and the dangers of texting while driving an SUV and reaching across the seat for a snickers bar -- recording not only the most memorable, and memorably outrageous, events of the past three decades, but also the often-overlooked absurdities of our daily lives.<br> <br></p><p>Nicole Hollander is the creator of Sylvia, an internationally syndicated comic strip that appears in over 80 newspapers, including the <i>Chicago Tribune</i>, the <i>Detroit News</i>, the <i>Boston Globe</i>, and the <i>Seattle Times</i>.

Ken Foster illuminates a profound lesson about saving a life: Doing it makes you able to do it."<br>--Amy Hempel, author of The Dog of the Marriage and Reasons to Live<br>"I read this at once, and could hardly bear to put it down. It delivers something crucial about bravery, the human spirit, and the place that dogs occupy in our landscapes.

This is a fascinating and useful book, full of great stories and practical knowledge. Ken&#x2019;s dogs are lucky to have found him, and so are his readers."<br>--Sean Wilsey, author of Oh the Glory of it All<br>"Foster&#x2019;s dogs are memorable, delightful characters, with vivid, poignant stories. The Dogs Who Found Me is a testament to the joys dogs bring, and to the beauty in the work of saving them."<br>--Rene Steinke, National Book Award finalist for Holy Skirts<br>"If you love dogs as much as Ken Foster, you will probably recognize yourself in much of The Dogs Who Found Me. You will remember your heart stopping or being shredded . . . only to be repaired with an even greater capacity to love."<br>--Terry Bain, author of You Are A Dog<br>"Pitbulls pitbulls pitbulls, and a man, like me, who loves them. Alternately brutal and sentimental, like the lives of the dogs he rescues. A very, very cool book."<br>--James Frey, author of A Million Little Pieces and My Friend Leonard<br>Disaster-prone writer and reluctant dog rescuer Ken Foster finds himself adopting an ever-growing collection of stray dogs, from a beagle abandoned in a New York City dog run to a pit bull in a Mississippi truck stop. Their circumstances offer a grounding counterpoint to his own misfortunes: the shock of New York City after 9/11, the evacuation of New Orleans during Hurricane Katrina, and the day his heart nearly stopped for good.<br>KEN FOSTER is the editor of two anthologies, including Dog Culture.

He was known as the king of Broadway, the most sought-after director-choreographer and show doctor who gave shape to <i>On the Town</i> (1944), <i>Call Me Madam </i>(1950), <i>The King and I </i>(1951), <i>Wonderful Town </i>(1953), <i>Peter Pan </i>(1954), <i>The Pajama Game</i> (1954), <i>Silk Stockings </i>(1955), <i>West Side Story </i>(1957), <i>Gypsy </i>(1959), <i>A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum</i> (1962), <i>Funny Girl </i>(1964), <i>Fiddler on the Roof </i>(1964), and many other classic musicals, winning four Tony Awards, two Oscars, and an Emmy.

He&#x2019;d hoped to study journalism, but his parents insisted he pursue a &#x201c;useful&#x201d; degree. Useful didn&#x2019;t mean compatible, however: by the following spring Robbins was failing two courses (mathematics and French) out of five, and his father, struggling financially from the Depression, told him his college days were over.<br> &nbsp;<br> Robbins wasn&#x2019;t sure what would become of him at this point, but whatever the possibilities, he later recalled, &#x201c;running the Comfort Corset Company was not among them.&#x201d; He persuaded his parents to give him a year to establish himself, and set out looking for a way into the world he felt he was called to: the world of art. After an unsuccessful attempt to apprentice himself to the art puppeteer Tony Sarg, the Basil Twist of his day, he was accepted (following a rocky first meeting) into the experimental modern ballet troupe of Senya Gluck Sandor, where his colleagues included Jos� Lim�n and where he attracted the notice of <i>The New York Times</i>&#x2019;s dance critic, John Martin. (It was at this point that, at Sandor&#x2019;s urging, he adopted a string of Anglicized stage names&#x2014;Robin Gerald, Gerald Robyns, Jerry Robyns&#x2014;before settling on Jerome Robbins.) He briefly worked backstage making props for the Stanislavski-influenced Group Theatre&#x2019;s production of <i>Johnny Johnson, </i>and at the Yiddish Art Theatre he appeared in a near walk-on in I. J. Singer&#x2019;s <i>Brothers Ashkenazi</i> (&#x201c;someone coughed so I missed your line,&#x201d; his aunt told him after she attended a performance). And following Sandor&#x2019;s advice, he began studying ballet&#x2014;which until then he had considered &#x201c;false . . . , out of date, and constricting.&#x201d; His first balletic appearance, partnering an older dancer named Lisa Parnova, was an awkward one, but he kept working and parlayed his studies&#x2014;funded with odd jobs&#x2014;into paid appearances in ballets by the Russian emigr� choreographer Michel Fokine at the World&#x2019;s Fair ground-breaking ceremonies and at Jones Beach&#x2019;s outdoor amphitheater. Finally, after a brief post&#x2013;Labor Day tryout appearance in 1937, he got a break that would help determine his future path: a ten-week, $200 job as a dancer for the 1938 summer season at a Pennsylvania resort, Camp Tamiment.<br> &nbsp;<br> In the world of the 1930s, Tamiment was the equivalent of Club Med: the place middle-class singles went in the summer for sun, fun, and the opposite sex&#x2014;and for the weekly Broadway-style revue directed by the camp entertainment director, Max Liebman. It was a training ground for Broadway (and movie) talent: among Robbins&#x2019;s fellow entertainers were Imogene Coca, Danny Kaye, and Carol Channing, as well as such dance-world figures as Dorothy Bird, Anita Alvarez, and Ruthanna Boris, and under Liebman&#x2019;s often-irascible and temperamental direction all were responsible for performing in, and sometimes creating the material for, the weekly revue. Robbins spent four summers at Tamiment, progressing from ensemble parts to solos, from working out dances anonymously with a small group of intimates to choreographing an entire revue, and his signature performing and choreographic style&#x2014;fluid, expressive, full of sharply observed details&#x2014;began to emerge.<br> &nbsp;<br> While appearing in <i>Keep Off the Grass,</i> he heard about an ambitious new venture called Ballet Theatre, a dance company founded by a New England heiress named Lucia Chase, which would employ a permanent roster of principals, soloists, and corps members to present a mixture of classic European ballet and edgier work created by a cadre of contemporary choreographers&#x2014;including Antony Tudor, Bronislava Nijinska, Agnes de Mille, and Eugene Loring&#x2014;in regular New York appearances supplemented with national tours. The curtain had barely risen on its first short season at the now-demolished Center Theatre in Rockefeller Center than Robbins began bombarding management with audition requests until he finally won a contract, first as a summer temporary, then as a permanent corps member. At first, dancers&#x2019; terms of employment were erratic: the company was engaged for two months in the fall of 1940 at the Chicago Lyric Opera, then had a brief season in New York in early 1941, at which point it appeared financing for the venture would dry up. Robbins returned to Tamiment for one last season, as a choreographer, but Ballet Theatre struck a deal with the impresario Sol Hurok that ensured the company&#x2019;s survival, and that fall Robbins went with them to Mexico.<br> &nbsp;<br> For the next four years Ballet Theatre would be the nursery that brought forth Robbins&#x2019;s mature talent, as a dancer (in such signature roles as Hermes in <i>Helen of Troy</i> and the puppet in <i>Petrouchka</i>) and eventually as a choreographer, broadening his horizons on tours around the United States and abroad and introducing him to a surrogate family of dancers, choreographers, composers, and other artists that gave him the camaraderie and acceptance he rarely found at home. The support was welcome, for this was a period of considerable conflict and anxiety for Robbins. His first real sexual attraction, to a man, had been followed by an affair with a woman, which had not been sustained; his family had accused him of consorting with &#x201c;bad company&#x201d; (code for homosexuals); and his professional ambition, always transparent, had brought him criticism that, in turn, made him doubt his talent and his worth. Traveling the country, he longed for a place to settle and call his own. He found friends, some of whom would be colleagues and companions for years, including the dancers Donald Saddler and Nora Kaye (to whom he would later be briefly engaged to be married), the director Mary Hunter, co-founder of the American Actors Company, and the playwright Horton Foote, with whom he had plans to collaborate on an elaborate danced and acted theater piece based on an African American folk myth. But even among these, he often felt lonely and vulnerable: &#x201c;made crudely, painted badly,&#x201d; as he described the title character in <i>Petrouchka,</i> who he thought was &#x201c;me in so many ways.&#x201d; He poured out his loneliness and conflicted emotions not only in his journals but in scenarios and fiction that he never sought to have produced or published.<br> &nbsp;<br> In the end, his vision of a kind of <i>American</i> theatrical dance, and his drive to create it, prevailed against his self-doubt. In 1943, tired of dancing in Russian boots and wigs, frustrated from bombarding Ballet Theatre management with scores of overcomplicated scenarios&#x2014;which featured Cecil B. DeMille&#x2013;sized casts of thousands&#x2014;in the hopes of getting a commission, he had an epiphany inspired by watching rehearsals of George Balanchine&#x2019;s nearly minimalist ballet <i>Apollo.</i> He realized he could do more with less: a ballet about three sailors on shore leave in the big city and the three girls they meet. Following his usual practice in previous efforts, he outlined all the action in detail and even specified the tone and tempos for the music, leaving very little to management&#x2019;s imagination, and when a work scheduled for the spring 1944 season fell through, Ballet Theatre&#x2014;nudged by his ally, the company&#x2019;s executive managing director, Charles Payne&#x2014;gave him the empty slot. He cast two friends, the firecracker Harold Lang as the rowdy, boisterous sailor and the dreamy, sweet-faced John Kriza as the lyrical one, and gave himself the bravura role of their &#x201c;smouldering&#x201d; dark companion. Hoping to produce the ballet inexpensively, the company suggested Robbins work with their musical arranger to cobble together a score from existing popular songs, but Robbins had more ambitious ideas. Eventually he persuaded Ballet Theatre to commission the then-unknown Leonard Bernstein to compose the score; since Bernstein was tethered to New York City by his job as assistant conductor of the New York Philharmonic, their collaboration had to be conducted long-distance, but on April 18, 1944, <i>Fancy Free,</i> with a set by Oliver Smith, premiered at the Metropolitan Opera House. It was an immediate, life-changing success. &#x201c;To come right to the point,&#x201d; said <i>The New York Times</i>&#x2019;s John Martin,<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Fancy Free&#x201d; . . . is a smash hit. This [is] young Robbins&#x2019; first go at choreography, and the only thing he has to worry about in that direction is how in the world he is going to make his second one any better. He has managed to get into this light-hearted little piece of American genre the same quality of humor which has always characterized his personal dancing, the same excellent actor&#x2019;s sense of the theatre, and some first-rate invention to boot. [T]he whole ballet, performance included, is just exactly ten degrees north of terrific.<br> &nbsp;<br> Overnight, in a stroke that could have come from the Lloyd Bacon/Busby Berkeley film <i>42nd Street,</i> the twenty-five-year-old Robbins had gone from youngster to star. His new life had begun.<br> &nbsp;<br> ...<br> &nbsp;<br> How I Almost Did Not Become a Dancer<br> <i>August 15, 1976</i><br> &nbsp;<br> There was no money to allow me to continue college even though I felt I could do much better than the first year, [but] I extracted a promise from my parents that for one year I could try my hand at what I wished. I wasn&#x2019;t at all sure what [things] I did want to do, but running the Comfort Corset Company was not among them.<br> &nbsp;<br> I had always been fascinated by marionettes and had even constructed a small cardboard theater in the basement of our house and had made a number of marionettes, designed the clothes, painted, built and lit the scenery, etc. I had read some books on puppetry and was most impressed by one [written] by Tony Sarg. So I looked up his name in the Manhattan phone book&#x2014;he lived in Greenwich Village&#x2014;blindly dressed in my most adult-looking clothes, went to his address and rang his bell. He lived in a rather dark ground floor apartment in a brownstone. I remember a short man, in a dim light, who wanted to know what I wanted.<br> &nbsp;<br> I said I wanted to be a puppeteer and would he take me on as an apprentice. His answer was a brief &#x201c;no, he didn&#x2019;t do that&#x201d;&#x2014;and I found myself in my best clothes out on the street again.<br> &nbsp;<br> So then I decided I&#x2019;d try dancing.<br> &nbsp;<br> Because my sister had worked with him and because I had watched rehearsals, she arranged an audition and interview with [Senya Gluck] Sandor.&nbsp; I felt about him then as I do about Balanchine now&#x2014;he was very much in the limelight, and reviews by Martin were not uncommon. He was the most stimulating creative man that I ever encountered.<br> &nbsp;<br> He greeted me (he knew me as Sonia&#x2019;s brother) and asked me to change into my dance clothes (bathing trunks and a t-shirt) and then put me through some very elementary movements, running, jumping, rhythmic sequences, etc. Then he asked me to do some improvisations. First he asked me to write large numbers in the air, from 0 to 9 with my arms, then to write different numbers with different dramatic contexts&#x2014;pleading, anger, as royalty, begging, etc. [T]hen he asked me to do one as Shiva, who both gave and took, blessed and damned. He put one gold spotlight on me and I took off. He said, <i>very </i>good&#x2014;get dressed and we&#x2019;ll talk. After I changed, he invited me for a tea or snack at the bar-restaurant across the street. I was very nervous; being with such a famous creative person, and honored and thrilled to be allowed to dine with him.<br> &nbsp;<br> We went into the bar-restaurant, seated ourselves in a booth, ordered I don&#x2019;t remember what, sitting opposite each other. Sandor must have sensed my anxiety. Then he said, I have to go to the bathroom&#x2014;do you want to wash your hands or anything. I said yes because it seemed more agreeable than saying no, even though I didn&#x2019;t need to wash my hands again. So, with Sandor leading the way we entered the narrow little john consisting of one urinal, one toilet, a sink, mirror and towel rack.<br> &nbsp;<br> While Sandor relieved himself I washed my hands, using the liquid soap that hung in an inverted jar extended out over the wash basin. You tapped up on the little peg on the bottom of the container jar and it released the soap with that particular certain public toilet odor. As I was drying my hands, in silence, Sandor took his turn at the sink and began washing his hands and then next he leaned forward toward the wash basin to splash some water on his luxurious black long hair before combing it. But as he leaned into the bowl I noticed that his head bobbing up and down was about to hit the short peg of the soap dispenser and I quickly passed my hand under the peg to stop that disaster. But an even more terrible disaster occurred. My hand pressed against the peg and out poured a stream of liquid soap down onto and into the black head of hair of Sandor, who, not knowing what was happening, continued to splash water on his head. A shampoo commercial could not outdo the sudsy foam that ensued. Horror-stricken, I watched as Sandor finally felt something wrong, looked at his hands and lifted his head to see in the mirror what looked like a soapy Harpo Marx. He held still&#x2014;then wheeled around and stared at me. I don&#x2019;t know what my expression was like. All I know is that I knew for sure that my career as a dancer had come to a calamitous end in the bathroom of that bar-restaurant. Sandor, dearest man, must have seen everything in my face and he read all of it, the accident and my ashen-faced response to it and after a good look, he turned right back to the basin and washed the soap out of his hair as I stood by in complete misery. When he seemed rid of the soap he mopped up with his handkerchief, slicked his hair back with his comb and then we both went back to our booth and never ever to this day talked about what happened in the men&#x2019;s room.<br> &nbsp;<br> What he did say was something like this: I was, he felt, very talented, but my wanting to be a dancer was to be very discouraged. It was a hard terrible life, one that certainly would never earn [me] enough to protect a future, no less make a present living. Dance was <i>not </i>popular in the US, male dancers were thought of as freaks, and the effort needed and the rewards of succeeding were totally out of balance.<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> But he said, you think it over, and if you want to work with me I&#x2019;ll take you on.<br> &nbsp;<br> I thought it over then and there for less than a second and said, Yes, I want.<br> &nbsp;<br> Flopping<br> <i>September 9, 1976</i><br> <i>&nbsp;</i><br> The first notice I ever received was written by Anatole Chujoy. It was a review of a dancer named Lisa Parnova [who] did a concert of mostly solo dances at The Lexington YMHA. She was a dark beautiful woman, and I have no idea of how much ability she had as a technician. Needing a partner for two dances she&#x2019;d asked Sandor for help in finding one&#x2014;and he suggested me. It was [a] mistake, an ill match from every angle. To start with I&#x2019;d had at that point four classes for beginner&#x2019;s ballet. I scarcely knew the terms. I had absolutely no partnering ability. I&#x2019;d never lifted a woman or protected her pirouettes. And lastly, I was a kid, still growing, physically smaller than Lisa, and certainly much younger.<br> &nbsp;<br> We did two dances.

Some songs truly did come together over time without an identifiable author. Others draw melodies and motifs from obscure sources but, in the hands of a particular artist, take a final, indelible shape. And, as in the case of Dylan&#x2019;s &#x201c;Hollis Brown,&#x201d; there are songs that were written by a single author but that communicate as anonymous productions, as if they were folk songs passed down over many generations.</p><p>In three songs that seem to be written by no one, Marcus shows, we discover not only three different ways of talking about the United States but three different nations within its formal boundaries.</p></p><p>Greil Marcus is the author of <i>The Doors</i>, <i>Mystery Train</i>, and other books.Superb.

In her early teens, the author was sent off to Scotland to support her parents by picking potatoes in the fields, where she was paid a pittance and forced to sleep in cowsheds. Then as a young adult, she gutted fish in Scottish ports, working outdoors in freezing winters and blistering summers. In an inspiring story of triumph over adversity, Julia tells how she battled through dark periods by knitting sweaters into the early hours of the morning every day to support her family. Then, in an amazing twist of fate, this hard-working woman and dedicated mother watched from the wings as her off-spring flourished in life.</p><p>Now in her eighties, Julia O&#39;Donnell continues to live in Kincasslagh, County Donegal, surrounded by her friends and family.</p><h2>Confessions of a Pagan Nun</h2><p>This moving and subtle tale both embodies and confirms the enduring power of language. Gwynneve (Gwi-NEEV) is raised in a village of fishermen and pigkeepers at the height of Ireland's transition from Paganism to Christianity. All around her the new doctrines of Patrick and the "tonsured men" are inexorably driving out the old Druid ways. When Gwynneve loses the two figures she loved the most&#x2014;her mother succumbing to disease, her outspoken Druid teacher abducted by his enemies&#x2014;she leaves her village and finally takes refuge in the convent of Saint Brigit. Of her past life and loves she retains only intangibles: her mother's love of nature and independent mind, her teacher's gift of literacy and addiction to truth. Clinging to the one constant and comforting force in her life&#x2014;the power of words, and their offer of immortality to those who set them down&#x2014;she records her memories surreptitiously, interrupting her assigned tasks of transcribing Patrick and Augustine. But disturbing events from the present keep intervening. Finally, her headstrong ways and growing criticism of the monastery's new abbot lead to the accusation that she consorts with demons. The story's tragic conclusion confirms both Gwynneve's fears and her powers: centuries after she and her tormentors sink back into the Irish earth, her words remain to haunt and inspire us.</p><p>Kate Horsley lives in Albuquerque, New Mexico, and teaches creative writing at Central New Mexico Community College. A poet as well as a novelist, Horsley has a PhD in American Studies and has published five novels. Her book A Killing in a New Town was the winner of the 1996 Western States Book Award for Fiction.&nbsp;When we think of the Dark Ages, we often think of a dim, primitive society where people struggled just to stay alive, with no room for spirituality or philosophy. The cool, clear, gemlike precision of Horsley's (Crazy Woman) new novel tells another tale. Gwynneve is born into a world suspended between paganism and Christianity: Ireland circa 500 C.E. While the rest of Europe was well on its way toward Christianity, at this time Ireland remained much closer to its pagan traditions. After losing her mother, Gwynneve trains as a druid and practices as one for many years. By the time she sets her story down, though, she has converted to Christianity and become a nun. The book is written as a memoir detailing her journey from her birth into a pagan tribe to her end as a Christian with near-saintly status. Her story is not just that of a strong woman making her way in a hostile world. It is also the story of what happens to a country when a new religion takes the place of the old. A beautifully written and thought-provoking book; recommended for all fiction collections.Wendy Bethel, Southwest P.L., Grove City, OH <br>Copyright 2001 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Death of Ivan Ilych</h2><p>The Death of Ivan Ilych By Lev Nikolayevich Tolstoy</p><p>Hailed as one of the world's supreme masterpieces on the subject of death and dying, The Death of Ivan Ilyich is the story of a worldly careerist, a high court judge who has never given the inevitability of his death so much as a passing thought. But one day death announces itself to him, and to his shocked surprise he is brought face to face with his own mortality. How, Tolstoy asks, does an unreflective man confront his one and only moment of truth? <br>This short novel was the artistic culmination of a profound spiritual crisis in Tolstoy's life, a nine-year period following the publication of Anna Karenina during which he wrote not a word of fiction. A thoroughly absorbing and, at times, terrifying glimpse into the abyss of death, it is also a strong testament to the possibility of finding spiritual salvation.Leo Tolstoy was a Russian novelist and moral philosopher noted for his ideas of nonviolent resistance. His diary reveals an incessant pursuit of a morally justified life. He was known for his generosity to the peasants.His best known novels are War and Peace (1869), which Tolstoy regarded as an epic rather than a novel, and Anna Karenina (1877). His work was admired in his time by Dostoyevsky, Checkov, Turgenev, and Flaubert, and later by Virginia Woolf and James Joyce.</p><h2>Reuben Sachs</h2><p>This historic book may have numerous typos, missing text, images, or index.

THE POETICAL W11RK.S OF...</p><p>Oscar Wilde wrote of this novel, &#x201c;Its directness, its uncompromising truths, its depth of feeling, and above all, its absence of any single superfluous word, make Reuben Sachs, in some sort, a classic.&#x201d; Reuben Sachs, the story of an extended Anglo-Jewish family in London, focuses on the relationship between two cousins, Reuben Sachs and Judith Quixano, and the tensions between their Jewish identities and English society. The novel&#x2019;s complex and sometimes satirical portrait of Anglo-Jewish life, which was in part a reaction to George Eliot&#x2019;s romanticized view of Victorian Jews in Daniel Deronda, caused controversy on its first publication. This Broadview edition prints for the first time since its initial publication in The Jewish Chronicle Levy's essay "The Jew in Fiction." Other appendices include George Eliot's essay on anti-Jewish sentiment in Victorian England and a chapter from Israel Zangwill's novel The Children of the Ghetto. Also included is a map of Levy's London with landmarks from her biography and from the "Jewish geography" of Reuben Sachs.Susan David Bernstein is a Professor of English, Jewish Studies, and Women s Studies at the University of Wisconsin-Madison.

Expanded to include more detailed coverage of tools, molds, formers, jigs and materials, this book is the ultimate, comprehensive guide.</p><p>From seasoning woods, shaping, carving and shanking handles, to a wide range of coloring and finishing methods, all aspects of this long-established craft are covered.

An uncle cultivated his interest in making sticks and encouraged him to enter his work in local craft shows. He lives near Lampeter.<br><br>Clive George's life-long interest in stickmaking and a fortuitous meeting, led him to collaborate in the production of this book.</p><h2>The Good Life: Seeking Purpose, Meaning, and Truth in Your Life</h2><p>Sharing from his own life, as well as the stories of others, Chuck Colson exposes the counterfeits of the good life and leads readers to the only true source of meaning and purpose, Jesus Christ. But he does that in an unusual way, allowing powerful stories to illustrate how people have lived out their beliefs in ways that either satisfy or leave them empty. Colson addresses seekers&#x2014;people looking for the truth. He shows through stories that the truth is knowable and that the truly good life is one that lives within the truth. Through the book, readers get to understand their own stories and find answers to their own search for meaning, purpose, and truth.</p><p>The well-known story of <b>Charles Colson's</b> transformation from President Richard Nixon's "hatchet man" who was "incapable of humanitarian thoughts" to founder of the Prison Fellowship Ministries and internationally recognized Christian author and speaker is a triumph of God finding a man and a man finding God. His 1973 conversion to Christianity was followed by a guilty plea to obstruction of justice and a seven-month prison sentence in 1974. He founded Prison Fellowship Ministries in 1976, fulfilling a promise made to fellow inmates that he would "never forget those behind bars."With the aid of the excellent parable-writer/exegete Harold Fickett (see <i>Conversations with Jesus</i>, 1999), Colson reconfirms that he is a premier popular practitioner of Christian persuasion, especially for the un- and spottily churched. Instead of reflexively citing and quoting the Bible, he alludes to it, sparingly and pointedly, and his exempla come from broadly familiar sources, such as the movie <i>Saving Private Ryan</i>, and the lives of figures ranging from Olivier Messiaen to Madalyn Murray O'Hair, from death-row convicts to business tycoons. He considers good living and its grounds, which is to say, living for others while seeking and acting upon the truth. The book's long first part contrasts careers of self-motivation and hedonism with others of service and suffering to demonstrate that the former eventuate in disillusion and emptiness, the latter in fulfillment and satisfaction, independent of material success; the short second part discusses the rewards of giving. In the third part, Colson argues against relativism and for absolute truth, considerably more substantially than the ruck of "conservative Christian" commentators do; the exempla in this part are particularly engrossing and frequently high toned (e.g., the spiritual journey of Wallace Stevens). The concluding part considers ultimate things--providence, death, infinite love--and overtly proselytizes, very considerately, for the first time in the book. Colson's temperateness and reasonableness in all that comes before the call to faith increases its appeal, especially to those repelled by ranting and tears. <i>Ray Olson</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

Published at only twenty-two, she peaked early and found critical but not commercial success. Now her former life is gone, along with her writing career and beloved husband. A reclusive widow, her sole companion a dour, flatulent basset hound who barely tolerates her, her daily mantra <i>Kill Me Now,</i> she is a loner afraid to be alone. Her only bright spot each week is the writing class that she teaches at the university extension.<br><br>This semester&#x2019;s class is full of the usual suspects: the doctor who wants to be the next Robin Cook, the overly enthusiastic repeat student, the slacker, the unassuming student with the hidden talent, the prankster, the know-it-all.... Amy&#x2019;s seen them all before. But something is very different about this class---and the clues begin with a scary phone call in the middle of the night and obscene threats instead of peer evaluations on student writing assignments. Amy soon realizes that one of her students is a very sick puppy, and when a member of the class is murdered, everyone becomes a suspect.

Epileptic gathers together and makes available in English for the first time all six volumes of the internationally acclaimed graphic work.<br><br>David B. was born Pierre-Fran�ois Beauchard in a small town near Orl�ans, France. He spent an idyllic early childhood playing with the neighborhood kids and, along with his older brother, Jean-Christophe, ganging up on his little sister, Florence. But their lives changed abruptly when Jean-Christophe was struck with epilepsy at age eleven. In search of a cure, their parents dragged the family to acupuncturists and magnetic therapists, to mediums and macrobiotic communes. But every new cure ended in disappointment as Jean-Christophe, after brief periods of remission, would only get worse.<br><br>Angry at his brother for abandoning him and at all the quacks who offered them false hope, Pierre-Fran�ois learned to cope by drawing fantastically elaborate battle scenes, creating images that provide a fascinating window into his interior life. An honest and horrifying portrait of the disease and of the pain and fear it sowed in the family, Epileptic is also a moving depiction of one family&#x2019;s intricate history. Through flashbacks, we are introduced to the stories of Pierre-Fran�ois&#x2019;s grandparents and we relive his grandfathers&#x2019; experiences in both World Wars. We follow Pierre-Fran�ois through his childhood, adolescence, and adulthood, all the while charting his complicated relationship with his brother and Jean-Christophe&#x201d;s losing battle with epilepsy. Illustrated with beautiful and striking black-and-white images, Epileptic is as astonishing, intimate, and heartbreaking as the best literary memoir.</p><p>"David B has created a wildly beautiful fantasia on human frailty, on the making of an artist and the unmaking of his own brother -- a memoir that is hopeful and bitterly poignant all at once." -- Paul Collins, author of <i>Not Even Wrong: Adventures in Autism<br></i>David B. is a founding member of L&#x2019;Association, a group of French cartoonists who banded together as publishers in 1990 and have revolutionized European comics with their groundbreaking approach to format, subject matter, and style.

He researched and traced the path of Soto's expedition for more than seven years.</p>Ruthless conqueror of Central America and Peru's Inca empire, the Spanish conquistador Hernando de Soto is sometimes portrayed as a saintly bearer of civilization, while other biographers see a brutal butcher. To freelancer Duncan, this son of an impoverished Spanish squire?who became fabulously wealthy by looting gold and selling or working to death thousands of slaves in Panama and Nicaragua?was, above all, a gambler and insatiably ambitious megalomaniac. From 1539 to 1543, de Soto and his army of 600 men trekked 4000 miles through 10 future Southeastern U.S. states, seeking a nonexistent second Inca empire laden with gold. Instead they stumbled upon the Mississippians, a sophisticated culture of city- and mound-building natives. The Spaniards' systematic plunder, murder, warfare and enslavement of the Indians brought the collapse of their civilization. De Soto died of fever in 1542 at the age of 42; more than half his men were killed by the Mississippians. Drawing on expedition logs, colonial archival manuscripts, eyewitness accounts and recent archaeological finds, Duncan strips away decades of mythmaking to plumb the conquistador mentality in a vibrant, gripping biography.

Sydney Taylor's time-honored classic does just that. Life is rich for the five mischievous girls in the family. They find adventure in visiting the library, going to market with Mama, even dusting the front room. Young readers who have never shared a bedroom with four siblings, with no television in sight, will vicariously experience the simple, old-fashioned pleasures of talk, make-believe, and pilfered penny candy. The family's Jewish faith strengthens their ties to each other, while providing still more excitement and opportunity for mischief. Readers unfamiliar with Judaism will learn with the girls during each beautifully depicted holiday. This lively family, subject of four more "all-of-a- kind" books, is full of unique characters, all deftly illustrated by Helen John. Taylor based the stories on her own childhood family, and the true-life quality of her writing gives this classic its page-turning appeal. <i>(Ages 9 to 12)</i>Meet the All-of-a-Kind Family -- Ella, Henny, Sarah, Charlotte, and Gertie -- who live with their parents in New York City at the turn of the century.<p> Together they share adventures that find them searching for hidden buttons while dusting Mama's front parlor and visiting with the peddlers in Papa's shop on rainy days. The girls enjoy doing everything together, especially when it involves holidays and surprises.</p><p> But no one could have prepared them for the biggest surprise of all!</p></p><h2>The Testament of Loki</h2><p>In the sequel to <i>The Gospel of Loki</i>, Loki&#x2019;s adventures continue when he finds a way out of the end of the world and plans to restart the power of the Norse gods.<br><br>The end of the world&#x2014;also known as Ragnarok to the Norse gods&#x2014;has occurred, and Loki has been trapped in a seemingly endless purgatory, in torture, until he finds a way to escape. It seems that he still exists in the minds of humanity and uses that as a way to our time.<br> <br>Back in the ninth world (Earth), Loki finds himself sharing the mind of a teenage girl named Jumps, who is a bit of a mess. She&#x2019;s also not happy about Loki sneaking his way into her mind, since she was originally calling on Thor. Worse, her friends have also been co-opted by the gods: Odin, Jump&#x2019;s one-eyed best friend in a wheelchair, and Freya, the pretty one. Thor escapes the netherworld as well and shares the mind of a dog, and he finds that it suits him.<br> <br>Odin has a plan to bring back the Norse gods ascendancy, but Loki has his own ideas on how things can go&#x2014;and nothing goes according to plan.</p><p>Joanne Harris (MBE) was born in Barnsley in 1964, of a French mother and an English father.

The plain below was cratered with fires and laddered with smoke. Ragnar�k, the End of the Worlds, lay upon us like a pall. Odin had fallen; and Thor; and T�r. Gullveig-Heid, the Sorceress, stood at the helm of the Fleet of the Dead. Dark Lord Surt, on dragon&#x2019;s wings, approached from out of Chaos, and where his shadow fell, the dark was absolute, and terrible. Bif-rost was broken, and as I fell, clutching at the last of my glam, I saw the great bridge come apart at last in a fractal of brightness, spilling its millions of cantrips and runes into the wild and shattered air, so that, for a moment, everything was rainbow. . . .<br> <br>Okay, stop. Stop. Wind back. That&#x2019;s the official version, the tourist&#x2019;s guide to Ragnar�k. Bit much to take in all at once, I know; and yet you&#x2019;ll need to understand some of what happened in order to grasp the magnitude of our rise and fall. Luckily&#x2014;or maybe not&#x2014;there&#x2019;s an official record. Delivered first as a prophecy, it&#x2019;s now all that passes for history among what&#x2019;s left of our followers. The Prophecy of the Oracle: a poem of thirty-six stanzas, outlining the rise and fall of the Worlds, and retold through the centuries by every bard who wielded a lute, or hack with a penchant for drama.<br> <br>That was the first Age, Ymir&#x2019;s time.<br> <br>There was no land or sea.<br> <br>Just void between two darknesses,<br> <br>No stars by which to see.<br> <br>From the birth of the Worlds in fire and ice, to their end in frozen darkness, the Oracle predicted it all. The rise of the gods of Asgard, their Golden Age, and their eventual fall were laid out in those thirty-six stanzas. The struggle out of Chaos; the quest for the runes of the Elder Script; the many adventures and exploits of Odin, leader of the clan; of Thor, his mighty, though somewhat intellectually challenged son; of one-handed T�r; of Freyja of the falcon cloak, Hawkeye Heimdall, and Balder the Fair&#x2014;and of course, Loki, the Trickster (that&#x2019;s me); recruited from Chaos by Odin himself, though not given credit in the text for any of his virtues, his role in the narrative reduced to the series of tragic events that marred the latter part of his career, much as the Titanic has unfairly become a byword for disaster, rather than a celebration of its many sterling qualities. Still, water under the bridge, now. But the fact remains. There was more to me than trickery and betrayal. Not much more, TBH. Nevertheless, my point stands. Never trust an Oracle.<br> <br>The Aesir came. On Ida&#x2019;s plain<br> <br>The new gods built their kingdom.<br> <br>Here they raised their citadel, their courts,<br> <br>Their seats of wisdom.<br> <br>The Oracle predicted that, too: the building of the Sky Citadel, its rainbow bridge, its gleaming halls, the beauty and the splendour. Then came the creeping of unrest; the breaking of our brotherhood; the final betrayal of the gods by one whom Odin had himself betrayed. Our end was inescapable: Our fate was woven into the tale like a double skein of mortality. That knowledge tainted everything. Even at the pinnacle of our achievements, the Prophecy of the Oracle cast its shadow over us. And worst of all, it was a lie&#x2014;a lie designed to bring about the very doom we sought to escape. The Aesir fell. Game over. Boo-hoo.<br> <br>So. To recap. The story so far: God (that&#x2019;s Odin) meets demon (that&#x2019;s me). God recruits demon from Chaos, with a view to exploiting his talents. God&#x2019;s friends and fellow deities take a somewhat dim view of this, as, through a combination of hubris, predestination, and increasingly bad life choices, demon goes a bit off the rails; falls into bad company; wreaks havoc; causes the odd death and eventually finds himself chained to a couple of rocks in Netherworld; is rescued by the Sorceress just in time to play his part in the engineering of Ragnar�k, including the fall of his erstwhile friends, before realizing that the house always wins, whichever colour card you play&#x2014;<br> <br>I could have swung the outcome, you know. Even then, if Odin had acknowledged his mistake, I like to think they could have been saved. But Odin believed in the Oracle. That thrice-damned bauble had his ear, and somehow it managed to steer us towards the rocks we&#x2019;d been trying to avoid. And Odin was a stiff-necked fool, and the rest of the gods always hated me. And so we lost Asgard, and they fell&#x2014;Thor, T�r, even the Old Man himself.<br> <br>I see your fate, O sons of earth.<br> <br>I hear the battle calling.<br> <br>Odin&#x2019;s folk prepare to ride<br> <br>Against the shadows falling.<br> <br>As for Yours Truly, I plunged to my fate in the arms of my nemesis, Heimdall, having just thrown the Oracle&#x2014;Mimir&#x2019;s severed and calcified head&#x2014;from the ruins of Bif-rost and into the icy waste below. And in those last moments of free fall, with the giant shadow of Chaos looming above me, oblivion seemed the most promising of my few remaining options. The Prophecy put it quite well:<br> <br>Once more the Wolf at Hel&#x2019;s gate greets<br> <br>Asgard&#x2019;s heroes, one by one.<br> <br>Battle rages, Worlds collide.<br> <br>Stars fall. Once more, Death has won.<br> <br>Actually, in my case, Death wasn&#x2019;t really the problem. The Ruler of Hel owed me a favour, and as I fell into the dark, I was already working out a scheme to talk her into redeeming it. No, the problem was Chaos; the element into which I&#x2019;d been born, and into which I would be reclaimed as soon as I left my corporeal form&#x2014;and knowing the Lord of Chaos, I guessed my welcome wouldn&#x2019;t involve tea and little fairy cakes.<br> <br>There&#x2019;s a special place reserved for renegades of Chaos. It has no bars, it has no doors, and yet it constrains more efficiently than any dungeon of the known Worlds. The Black Fortress of Netherworld: a prison more secure than Death; because Death at least is escapable&#x2014;in theory, in any case&#x2014;and no one I knew of had ever escaped a cell in the Black Fortress. I&#x2019;d seen some bad things in my time&#x2014;and done a few, if truth be told. I&#x2019;d laughed in the face of Death more times than Thor could shake a hammer at, but right now, things were not looking good for Your Humble Narrator.<br> <br>Don&#x2019;t think I didn&#x2019;t have a plan. I always have a plan. But as a traitor, both to the gods and to their enemies in Chaos, I was currently persona non grata all across the Nine Worlds. If I survived my fall from the sky (which currently didn&#x2019;t seem likely), and if I escaped Surt&#x2019;s shadow (which seemed even less so), there would be nowhere for me to hide. Wherever I went, whatever I did, Death was the only escape for me. And so I fell, and hit the ground, which turned out to be every bit as hard as it had looked from the top of Bif-rost.<br> <br>Ouch.<br> <br>Stop there for a moment. Take a second to contemplate the tragedy of my demise&#x2014;the tragedy and the irony&#x2014;because, as I slipped into darkness, believing the Worlds had ended, still hoping to enter Hel&#x2019;s kingdom, or perhaps simply to disperse into a glorious trail of fire, I was cruelly snatched away at the moment of my dissolution, and thrown into the most terrible place imagined by god or demon: the Black Fortress of Netherworld, where the fun was just beginning.<br> <br>You see, that wasn&#x2019;t the end of the Worlds. Turns out it was only the end of our world, the end of our supremacy. So many gods fall into the trap of assuming that the Worlds will end when their little kingdoms collapse. In fact, the Worlds are like the tide, expanding and contracting, while gods, and men, and demons roll like sand under the waves. We were no exception. The Aesir of Asgard, overthrown and humbled into the dust. So shoot me&#x2014;I don&#x2019;t grieve for them, who never would have grieved for me.<br> <br>And so I was damned&#x2014;but dry your tears. There isn&#x2019;t a dungeon I can&#x2019;t escape, given time and incentive. My time in the Black Fortress gave me both, in more-than-ample quantities. This is the story of how I escaped the most secure dungeon in all Nine Worlds, and some of what happened afterwards, and some of the lessons I learnt on the way. I can&#x2019;t pretend it made me a wiser, humbler person, but I did pick up a few things&#x2014;things about stories, and friendships, and dreams, and what it&#x2019;s like to be human.<br> <br>Yes, human. Didn&#x2019;t I tell you once that god and dog are only a revolution apart? In spite of all the splendour and pomp and exhortations to be more god, of holy wars and heresies, of miracles and martyrdoms, everything turns, and turns, and turns. Order; Chaos; darkness; light. Rinse and repeat. Reboot and replay.<br> <br>So, once more with feeling: Let&#x2014;<br> <br>there&#x2014;<br> <br>be&#x2014;<br> <br>light.</p><h2>Barnaby Volume Two</h2><p>The long-lost comic strip masterpiece by Crockett Johnson, legendary children&#x2019;s book author (Harold and the Purple Crayon, The Carrot Seed), collected in full and designed by graphic novelist and Barnaby superfan Daniel Clowes (Ghost World, Wilson). Vol. 2 collects the years 1944-1945 of 5-year-old Barnaby Baxter and his Fairy Godfather J.J. O&#x2019;Malley&#x2019;s misadventures. The cigar-chomping, bumbling con-artist and fast-talker O&#x2019;Malley takes Barnaby on a trip to D.C. to serve his term in Congress. Also, Gus the Ghost and O&#x2019;Malley follow the Baxters to their seaside cottage, enlisting Barnaby to join them on a treasure hunt. Plus Wall St., Ermine hunters, soap salesmen and more! Adored by all ages, Barnaby&#x2019;s deft balance of fantasy, timeless humor and elegant cartooning will delight even the most sophisticated reader (Chris Ware (Building Stories) loves it), much as it did in its original run, attracting fans as diverse as Dorothy Parker, Charles Schulz, W.C. Fields, Gardner Rea, Milton Caniff, Rockwell Kent and Louis Untermeyer.</p><p><p><strong>Crockett Johnson</strong> was the pen name of cartoonist and children&#x2019;s book illustrator David Johnson Leisk (October 20,1906&#x2013;July 11, 1975).

O'Malley, as he tries to get Congress to back the building of a dam, accidentally exposes insurance fraud, and causes a huge stock market crash by trying to buy a pair of morning trousers. Throughout it all, Barnaby's parents shush and cajole him to try and forget about his "imaginary friend" Mr. O'Malley, and seem to just miss meeting him again and again. Adults &#x2014;Barnaby's family excepted&#x2014; are persistently depicted as craven opportunists and the mystical folk that populate the book are single-minded na�fs, with only Barnaby's friend Jane shown to be flatly, hilariously sensible, and critical of everything that goes on. This second volume reprints two years of the comic strip, and once again bookends the content with essays and a thorough compilation of its many allusions to provide context for the strip's importance, popularity, and scope. Included reproductions of the cover art of contemporary collections state that the comic was and is for adults, and the elevated vocabulary and historical and social references would back that up, but the book should slyly, winkingly appeal to almost all ages.&#x2014;Benjamin Russell, Belmont High School, NH</p><h2>Carl Rogers on encounter groups, (Harrow books)</h2><p>Carl Rogers (1902-1987) was an influential American psychologist and among the founders of humanistic psychology.</p><p></p><h2>Close Combat: Book VI of the Corps</h2><p>On an island in the Pacific during World War II, Major Jack Dillon struggles to succeed as a combat correspondent and Sergeant McCoy is shocked by the brutality of battle.

He lives in Fairhope, Alabama, and Buenos Aires, Argentina.&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;Set in 1942, the sixth book (following Line of Fire ) in Griffin's series about The Corps revolves around a war bond tour featuring Marine heroes of the Guadalcanal campaign. Series fans will recognize the central characters, among them Marine general and presidential troubleshooter Fleming Pickering, his fighter pilot son Pick, and movie mogul Homer Dillon, a Marine for the duration. Griffin has Marine Corps lore and trivia down pat, and he uses the bond-tour story line to convey the public-relations aspects of modern war. Essentially, however, the novel succeeds because the alcoholic and amorous exploits of its stateside heroes could be mink-lined wish fulfillment for the fantasies of the average soldier--most of the "close combat" here takes place in various bedrooms. <br>Copyright 1992 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Crossing (The Last Cavaliers: One)</h2><p><p>From the beloved author of the bestselling House of Winslow series comes a new trilogy about the Civil War.

His Nobel Lecture offers a powerful defense of poetry as &#34;the ship and the anchor&#34; of our spirit within an ocean of violent, divisive world politics.</p><p>In his 1995 Nobel lecture, Heaney speaks earnestly about the role of poetry in everyday life?it must be "not only a surprising variation played upon the world, but a retuning of the world itself"?an instrument of shock by which the perception of reality is set right, or at least set anew. Certainly Heaney's own poetry aspires to this goal, assisted by the cobblestone physicality of Irish speech ("And the train tore past with the stoker yelling/ Like a balked king from his iron chariot") and the tragic, almost surreal political climate of Northern Ireland. His latest collection draws on the past-personal, historical, mythic?to articulate an innocence recollected in bitter knowledge, prefigurings of a present discerned only in hindsight. Vivid sounds and smells of childhood compete with acrid reminders of yesterday's truck bombing ("Two Lorries") or drive-by assassination ("Keeping Going"). Nothing?not even memory?Heaney implies, is truly safe, and there is "No such thing/ as innocent/ bystanding"; nevertheless, he strives to create the balance that poetry makes possible, defined in his Nobel lecture as touching "the base of our sympathetic nature while taking in at the same time the unsympathetic reality of the world to which that nature is constantly exposed." The reader's challenge is not to be carried helplessly forward by random events but to take sides, to risk the exposure?of conscience, of values?that Heaney risks as poet and to bear the best of what's discovered there into a refigured world. Both books are recommended for most poetry collections.?Fred Muratori, Cornell Univ.

This compelling memoir begins in the heart of apartheid South Africa where the author lived under conditions of zealous racism until he was 12 years old. Following are the two pivotal years he spent with his grandfather in India, learning the lessons that would undo his anger and cultivate a profound activism. His account also describes living with his parents in religious and socially activist communities in South Africa and India. This book presents the practical wisdom the author learned from his grandfather revolving around family, men and women, simplicity, religious unity, humility, truth, and nonviolence.</p><p>Born in 1934 in South Africa, Dr. Arun Gandhi has dedicated his life to carrying the message of peace. He is a former reporter for the Times of India, and is co-author (with his wife, Sunanda) of The Forgotten Woman: The Untold Story of Kastur Gandhi, Wife of Mahatma Gandhi. After founding India&#x2019;s Center for Social Unity, an organization dedicated to alleviating poverty and caste discrimination, he came to the United States in 1987 to study and compare the prejudices in South Africa, India and the U.S. Four years later, he and Sunanda established the M. K. Gandhi Institute for Nonviolence, which is based at Christian Brothers University in Memphis, Tennessee. Dr. Gandhi is a tireless advocate for the principles of nonviolence, working with young people, in the criminal justice system, and with nonviolence organizations. He also appears at conferences and workshops throughout the United States, addressing issues of racism, nonviolence and international cooperation.Humble and reflective . . . .

He hops up some steps and finds himself in a place filled with light and warmth and a tall, sparkling tree. He begins to sing but is scared into silence by two voices, one big and one small. It is then that he makes a marvelous discovery. Eve Bunting&#x2019;s text is filled with her customary tenderness and charm, and Timothy Bush has captured its mood in his luminous illustrations. Together they create a memorable holiday book about a cricket who discovers that though he may be small, he is not insignificant.</p><p><p>Eve Bunting has written&nbsp;over two hundred&nbsp;books for children, including the Caldecott Medal-winning <i>Smoky Night,</i> illustrated by David Diaz, <i>The Wall</i>,<i> Fly Away Home</i>, and <i>Train to Somewhere</i>. She lives in Southern California.</p>A cricket who feels "small and worthless in the bigness of night" finds his way into a cheery house and onto a Christmas tree, where his song is mistaken by a child for the voice of an angel. Bunting (see also The Bones of Fred McFee, under "Halloween," and One Candle, under "Hanukkah"), relates this affectionate tale in taut prose, and Bush's cricket's-eye-view watercolors seem almost to glow. In the end, as Cricket gazes at his reflection in the face of a shiny angel ornament, he ponders an adult's comment that angels sing "in the voices of crickets," then realizes that "he was small, then. But not worthless." The cricket's progression from the darkness of night to the luminosity of the revelatory scene underscores his growing sense of wonder.

Students who do well in algebra are better prepared for college entrance exams and for college in general. But it can be challenging for some students (and their parents). With 36 half-hour lessons, this course was developed to teach students and parents the concepts and procedures of first-year algebra in an easily accessible way. Indeed, anyone wanting to learn algebra from the beginning or needing a thorough review will find this course an ideal tutor. Professor James Sellers, an award-winning educator at The Pennsylvania State University, takes the fear out of learning algebra by approaching it with a friendly and reassuring spirit. Most students won&#39;t have a teacher as unhurried and as attentive to detail as Dr. Sellers, who explains everything clearly and, whenever possible, in more than one way so that the most important concepts sink in. After taking this course, students will be familiar with the terminology and symbolic nature of first-year algebra and will understand how to represent various types of functions (linear, quadratic, rational, and radical) using algebraic rules, tables of data, and graphs. They will also become acquainted with the types of problems that can be solved using such functions, with a particular eye toward solving various types of equations and inequalities. Algebra is loved, not feared, by students of Dr. Sellers</p><p></p><h2>Hidden Figures: The American Dream and the Untold Story of the Black Women Mathematicians Who Helped Win the Space Race</h2><p><p><strong>The<em> </em>#1<em> New York Times </em>bestseller</strong></p><p><strong>The phenomenal true story of the black female mathematicians at NASA whose calculations helped fuel some of America&#x2019;s greatest achievements in space.

For an instant I did not know where I was. Thus it must feel to be newborn, unclaimed.</p><p>A sweet breeze was stealing across me as I lay quietly. A sea breeze. I was on a shore somewhere. I raised my head and at once I was back in the world I knew. I was at Antium. I was in my villa bedroom that opened out onto the sea itself.</p><p>In the stillness, I arose and left Poppaea sleeping, her lips curved in a smile as she dreamed of something pleasurable. Pleasurable&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. our stay here in Antium had been pleasurable. Far enough from Rome to put thoughts of it aside, to live secluded here by the sea. For a brief time.</p><p>Quietly I walked over to the window and pushed back the filmy curtains. The horizon outside was white, making it impossible to see where the sky ended and the sea began. A pale moon was sinking, caught in the clouds. Last night it had been bright, penetrating, high. Now, still full but setting, it faded and became indistinct.</p><p>Last night&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. how exultant I had been, performing at last my epic on the Fall of Troy, on the stage here. The hard work of composing it had taken over a year, but with a furious burst the last few days, and now it had shown its face to the world, and I had all the joy of an artist who has birthed a creation after a very long labor.</p><p>It was fitting that it had taken place here in Antium, where I myself had been born twenty-six years ago. And after a likewise long and difficult labor, for I had been born feet first&#x2014;an evil omen, some said. At the same time there had been other favorable omens, so which to heed? Clearly the favorable ones had prevailed, for I had been emperor now for nine years, having assumed the purple at an absurdly young age. There had been significant achievements in my reign already, most notably a peace settlement with Parthia, our historic enemy, achieved finally through diplomacy rather than arms. I had gifted the city of Rome with magnificent baths, a theater, and a covered market, and had instituted engineering works that improved harbors and aimed to protect shipping routes. What I most wanted, though, was to give Rome the greatest gift of all&#x2014;a conversion to the Greek sensibilities and aesthetics. That was much harder than building buildings and digging canals. But it was coming. I knew it.</p><p>The audience last night was proof of that. Many people had traveled from Rome to hear me perform on the cithara. It is a virtuoso instrument, from Greece. Apollo himself played it. Yes! Their eyes would be opened and they would learn to embrace these cultural treasures.</p><p>I looked fondly at my cithara, now propped up against the wall, resting from its labors last night. It was, of course, the finest that could be made, and I had the finest instructor, Terpnus, who had borne with me and taught me patiently. I was always reluctant to leave him behind in Rome, and knowing I was returning to him made it easier to go back.</p><p>Rome. In the growing light, I saw the message cylinders resting on the table. They had been delivered yesterday, sent by my trusted right-hand man and Praetorian prefect, Tigellinus. But I could not bring myself to look at them then. The day was too perfect to spoil with petty business about import duties or aqueduct repairs or cart traffic in the city. If you imagine that everything an emperor has to deal with is lofty and critical, I can assure you that it is not. It is a hundred tax questions to one diplomatic treaty or one war strategy decision.</p><p>I would look at the messages a little later. I had to. But this morning would be for relaxation, and planning for the inevitable return to Rome.</p><p>I had retreated here to escape the hot days in the city, but duty required me to preside over the Feriae Augusti in two weeks, the celebration beginning on August first that culminated on the thirteenth, fourteenth, and fifteenth, commemorating Roman victories over Dalmatia, Actium, and Egypt. As the celebrations featured horse races, the only bright spot was that perhaps then I would be cleared by my trainers to do something I had longed to do: race chariots competitively.</p><p>Oh, I had driven chariots, but never in a real public race. It was deemed too dangerous, and it is true, chariot racing has a high accident rate. But it was also the most exciting thing a person could do. My grandfather had been a successful chariot racer, and I liked to believe I had inherited his skill.</p><p>&#x201c;Begging your pardon, Caesar,&#x201d; my trainer had said, &#x201c;if a celebrated charioteer dies in a race, his family and fans mourn him. But if an emperor dies in one, the entire empire is bereft.&#x201d;</p><p>Tigellinus was more blunt. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s irresponsible of you to think of taking such chances.&#x201d; He paused. &#x201c;Especially as you have no heir. Do you want to spark a civil war, like we had after Julius Caesar was killed?&#x201d;</p><p>No heir. Oh, the pain of that. I had had a daughter, but she died a baby. And none since.</p><p>&#x201c;No,&#x201d; I admitted. I would not make Rome endure such agony again. But I still wanted to race chariots, calling upon the gods to protect me. Had they not done that so far?</p><p>But then there was the nagging thought of a disturbing prophecy I had been given by the sibyl I had visited at Cumae. Fire will be your undoing, she had said. When pressed further, she had added, Flames will consume your dreams and your dreams are yourself. But there were no fires at chariot races. So did that assure me that I was safe to embark on that activity?</p><p>As for fires, we had a very capable fire brigade in Rome. But perhaps the fire she spoke of was somewhere else? Or it was a metaphorical fire? People spoke of the fire of anger, the fire of lust, the fire of ambition. I was on fire about my art. Did she mean that would destroy me?</p><p>I shook my head. Put it out of your thoughts, I told myself. Think only of this fair day before you, a day to walk beside the water, to drink chilled juice of Persian peaches with the wife who is the dearest thing under heaven to you, to wait for the moon to rise upon you once again.</p><p>I left her to sleep while I walked outside to see the pearly sky lighten, promising a fair, tranquil day.</p><p>It was late morning before Poppaea stirred. I had finished reading the Rome dispatches&#x2014;they were as dull as I had feared&#x2014;and reread a portion of my Troy epic with a mind to revisions, when she rose from the bed, trailing silk behind her like clouds of glory. Encircling her neck was the glittering gold collar I had gifted her with last night. She had worn it to bed and now she ran her hands over it lovingly.</p><p>&#x201c;They say cold metal is a sad thing to lavish love on,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;But on you it looks worthy of love.&#x201d; It was studded with gems betokening the planets, moon, and sun, crafted from an Indian design I had commissioned.</p><p>&#x201c;Gold is easy to sleep with,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;In fact, it helped me to dream.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Ah, such dreams as gold gives.&#x201d; I rose and embraced her, the body-warmed gold indistinguishable from her own temperature. &#x201c;And it is cold no longer.&#x201d;</p><p>The sun was midway in the sky, burnishing the waves outside the window.</p><p>&#x201c;Shall we go to the grotto today? We haven&#x2019;t visited it yet.&#x201d; The ancient grotto, down at the far end of the quays, was a large one extending quite far into the hillside. Grottoes held a fascination for me, as so many stories of the gods placed them there. They reeked of the supernatural.</p><p>She stretched, raising her arms over her head, shaking her shining amber hair. &#x201c;I suppose we should. We do not have that much more time here.&#x201d; But she did not sound enthusiastic. &#x201c;But in the late afternoon,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;How do you have the energy, after last night?&#x201d;</p><p>I could never explain to her that performing invigorated me; it was idleness that drained me. &#x201c;I will meet you on the terrace,&#x201d; I said. I was eager to get outside, to breath in the fresh air.</p><p>Later that day, we sat out on the shaded terrace and watched the horizon. It was soothing and still. And I relished the mindlessness. No thinking. No thinking. Just sit with closed eyes and drift, reliving the night before.</p><p>Attendants brought us food, placing the trays down on a stand&#x2014;platters of cold ham and mullet, sage honey from Crete, bread, eggs, olives, and cherries, with juice or Tarentinum wine to wash it down. Lazily I reached out and took a handful of cherries.</p><p>Under her scarf Poppaea still wore the necklace. &#x201c;For I can&#x2019;t take it off just yet,&#x201d; she admitted.</p><p>If only the other people I showered with gifts showed their appreciation so openly, I thought.</p><p>I was just passing her the platter of eggs and olives when our idyll was interrupted by a panting, dusty, sweaty messenger who hurried out to us, flanked by two of the villa guards. His face was set in a grimace, matched by the expression on the guards&#x2019; faces. I stood up, the perfect day suddenly shattered.</p><p>&#x201c;Caesar, Caesar!&#x201d; he cried, falling to his knees and clasping his hands piteously. &#x201c;I come from Rome, from Tigellinus.&#x201d; His voice was a croak.</p><p>&#x201c;Well, what is it?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Rome is on fire! Rome is on fire!&#x201d; he shrieked. &#x201c;It is burning out of control!&#x201d;</p><p>I rose, unable to take in his words. &#x201c;On fire?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yes, yes! It started in the Circus Maximus, in one of the shops at the far end.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;When?&#x201d;</p><p>By this time, my wife had risen, too, and out of the corner of my eye I saw her gripping the gold necklace, but no longer languidly. I could sense the alarm and dread that was filling me transferring itself to her as she stared at the messenger.</p><p>&#x201c;Night before last&#x2014;and the northerly wind fanned the flames so they swept fast, down the length of the Circus. Then it started climbing the hills around it.&#x201d;</p><p>Rome was a fire trap, and we had had many fires in our history. To guard against this, Augustus had created his fire brigade of seven thousand men, the Vigiles Urbani, now under the command of Nymphidius Sabinus, a man bearing a striking resemblance to Caligula in looks. Whether true or a coincidence, this allowed him to claim he was Caligula&#x2019;s natural son. But what mattered that now?</p><p>&#x201c;What of the firefighters? Are they out?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yes, but helpless to stop it. The fire is spreading faster than they can contain it. The sparks jump over roofs and fields and flare up in new places. It was starting to climb the Palatine when I left!&#x201d;</p><p>I turned to Poppaea. I felt numb, not even able to truly believe what I was hearing. &#x201c;I must go,&#x201d; I said. Then I turned to the messenger. &#x201c;We&#x2019;ll ride together. A fresh horse for you.&#x201d;</p><p>It was midday when we set out, trailed by two guards, but darkness had fallen before we approached Rome. All along the ride I felt myself becoming more and more agitated, hoping that the messenger had exaggerated, or that the fire was already contained, or that it had not destroyed much besides the shops in the Circus.</p><p>Calm, calm, Nero, you must keep calm, think clearly.</p><p>But inside another picture was emerging&#x2014;of Rome destroyed, people dead or destitute, historical treasures lost forever, all when I was emperor, all happening while I was responsible for the safety of my people.</p><p>Rome was ruined under Nero, the city incinerated, nothing left but ashes.</p><p>As we neared the top of a hill near Rome, before we could see the city itself, a lurid color stained the night sky, orange and red and yellow, ugly fingers reaching up into the heavens, pulsating. Then we crested the hill and I gazed down on the city aflame. Clouds of smoke roiled upward, and spurts of color, clouds of sparks, and bursts of exploding stone and wood punctuated the darkness. The brisk wind blew ashes in my face, carrying the stench of burning cloth, garbage, and things unnamable.</p><p>It was true, all true.</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s worse!&#x201d; the messenger cried. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s still spreading! It&#x2019;s much bigger than when I left. Look, it&#x2019;s engulfed the hills!&#x201d;</p><p>Rome was being devoured. Suddenly I remembered the time when I had visited the Temple of Vesta and been overcome with a strange weakness and trembling, and rendered helpless. I was puzzled by it then, but now I knew it meant I was powerless to protect the sacred flame of Rome. And I understood the meaning of the sibyl and her prophecy that fire would be my doom.</p><p>I stood at the turning point of my life. This was my battlefield, the battlefield I had wondered if I would ever face. My ancestor Antony had faced his twice: at the battle of Philippi, when he crushed the assassins of Caesar, and the battle of Actium, when he himself was crushed by Octavian.</p><p>Either Rome and I perished together, or we survived together.</p><p>But no matter the outcome, there was only one choice: to go forward, to wade into battle.</p><p>&#x201c;Come,&#x201d; I said, urging my horse forward. &#x201c;Rome awaits.&#x201d;</p><p>And we descended the hill, heading into the maelstrom.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><br><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Chapter II</p><p>The hill was not steep but it was treacherous with winding paths, rocks and tree roots studded everywhere. The moonlight made it possible for us to see, and the increasing glow from the fire added more illumination.</p><p>My heart was thudding as if I had just run a stadion, and my head was swirling. The air was hot, muggy, and stifling, and the acrid smell of fire made it torture to breathe. We should have been attacked by swarms of insects, but the smoke and soot had banished them. The fire was still too far away for us to feel the heat directly, but I imagined I could anyway. From this distance the city looked as if it were just one mass; I could not discern the individual areas yet.</p><p>I stopped. &#x201c;You say it is bigger now?&#x201d; I asked the messenger.</p><p>&#x201c;Yes! When I left, it was contained in one area, and from a distance, looked like one campfire. Now it has ignited new sites all around itself.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;It will be light before we get there,&#x201d; I said. And by then, who knew what we would see?</p><p>We continued our ride downhill, picking our way slowly. Ahead of us, the demonic glow drew closer.</p><p>Fire. What did I know about fire? Very little, to be honest. I had never personally experienced one, not even a house fire; the only fire I knew was the imaginary one at Troy hundreds of years ago. But I had been generous in equipping the Vigiles with whatever they needed, and it was expensive: horse-drawn fire wagons with water pumps, hundreds of buckets, picks, axes, hooks, and even catapults for knocking down houses to create fire breaks. Surely such a trained and equipped force could contain the fire.</p><p>But if that was so, why was it spreading? If they could not put it out when it was small, what chance did they have of stopping it as it grew larger?</p><p>The wind suddenly shifted, and as it did, I saw a burst of fire in a new place as it ignited there. A column shot up toward the sky, sending embers swirling in a cloud that vanished quickly.</p><p>On we went; the moon began dipping toward the west, and a very faint hint of light appeared on the eastern horizon. But it was still very dark, except for the lurid throbbing red ahead of us. We climbed another hill and the city disappeared, but as we reached the summit, we were suddenly close, and the first h...</p></p><h2>The RDF Manual (Robotech RPG Book 2)</h2><p>The <b>RDF Manual</b> contains more data about the post-holocaust world of Macross.

They aren&#x2019;t sexually attracted to anyone, and they consider it a sexual orientation like gay, straight, or bisexual.<br><br>Asexuality is the invisible orientation. Most people believe that everyone&#x201d; wants sex, that everyone&#x201d; understands what it means to be attracted to other people, and that everyone&#x201d; wants to date and mate. But that&#x2019;s where asexual people are left out they don&#x2019;t find other people sexually attractive, and if and when they say so, they are very rarely treated as though that&#x2019;s okay.<br><br>When an asexual person comes out, alarming reactions regularly follow; loved ones fear that an asexual person is sick, or psychologically warped, or suffering from abuse. Critics confront asexual people with accusations of following a fad, hiding homosexuality, or making excuses for romantic failures. And all of this contributes to a discouraging master narrative: there is no such thing as asexual.&#x201d; Being an asexual person is a lie or an illness, and it needs to be fixed.<br><br>In <i>The Invisible Orientation</i>, Julie Sondra Decker outlines what asexuality is, counters misconceptions, provides resources, and puts asexual people&#x2019;s experiences in context as they move through a very sexualized world.

As an aromantic asexual woman, She is happily single and resides in Tampa, Florida."This is the first substantial book for the nonprofessional to emerge from the small but growing community of individuals who identify themselves as "asexual" i.e., not sexually attracted to anyone; a portion of the population quoted as being approximately one in 100 people. Decker (contributor, Huffington Post; Salon), who writes in the introduction about her own asexuality, emphasizes that this is an orientation that has to do with feelings, not actions. The author stresses fluidity and inclusiveness: asexuality may change over time; some asexual people enjoy romantic relationships while others have no interest; libido may be high or low; and some are happy in partnered relationships while others enjoy the single life. The language and concepts are clearly modeled on those of the LGBTQ community, with an emphasis on asexuality being a healthy orientation, rather than the result of a mental or physical illness. The final chapter addresses friends and family members of asexual people. <b>VERDICT</b> This title is an important resource for readers of any age who are struggling to understand their sexual orientation, or those who would like to better understand asexuality." <i>Library Journal</i>, starred review<br><br>"This fascinating book will make more space for thoughtful understanding of sexual diversity and desire and help us understand just how variable human sexuality really is. For sex educators, therapists and scholars, it&#x2019;s a must-read. For asexual people (or the 'A-questioning'), who are so frequently invisibilized and disrespected, it may well offer the kind of succor, support, and information that every person across the sex, gender, and partnering spectra deserves." Carol Queen, PhD, Founding Director, Center for Sex &amp; Culture and author of <i>Real Live Nude Girl: Chronicles of Sex-Positive Culture</i><br><br>"I'll admit it: I used to think asexuality was not real. I couldn't wrap my head around the concept sex is a huge part of my life, so how could it be insignificant to someone else? Boy, was I ignorant! This book is a comprehensive learning tool for those who are asexual, as well as those who are asexual curious. Advocating respect, this rare and precious resource will open your eyes and set the record straight in a clear and straightforward manner. Prepare to have your mind blown!" Kendra Holliday, creator of The Beautiful Kind blog<br><br>"<i>The Invisible Orientation</i> demystifies the common misconceptions that asexual people are broken, or that their orientation is the result of sexual abuse or trauma. Warm and thorough, it shines a light on asexuality throughout all stages of life, and acts as a positive guide for navigating successful relationships of all kinds, and with all genders and orientations." Violet Blue, author of <i>The Smart Girl's Guide to Privacy</i> and editor of the award-winning series <i>Best Women's Erotica</i><br><br>"This book shines a much-needed light on an experience that&#x2019;s far more common than most people realize. Julie Decker brings together the many different voices and stories of asexual people, presents lots of valuable information, and offers helpful insight about how non-asexual people can be supportive. If you or someone you know is or might be asexual, read this book. And if you&#x2019;re a sexuality or relationship professional, read this book. Asexuality is part of the sexuality spectrum and you need <i>The Invisible Orientation</i> on your shelves." Charlie Glickman, PhD, certified sexological bodyworker<br><br>"This is a long overdue book, offering the general purpose introduction to the subject which has heretofore been lacking. It is an essential addition to any academic reading list that encompasses asexuality and should be required reading for any therapists with an interest in sexuality. It provides a sense of what it is like to be asexual that can sometimes be missing from academic work and engages with the literature while nonetheless refusing to be constrained by it. It is also immensely readable, providing an authoritative overview that sign posts the reader who is keen to explore further. I can&#x2019;t recommend The Invisible Orientation highly enough and hope it has a wide readership. Given how effectively it critiques the myths surrounding asexuality, helping those who are not asexual themselves better understand something that can at first be deeply confusing, it is a book with the potential to make a positive difference to many people&#x2019;s lives and help combat what the author describes as the 'insidious form of exclusion' which asexual people continue to experience."

Born in the Midwest in 1927 and drawn to France at the tender age of twenty-four, Olney was unapologetically attracted to the style, flavors, and tastes of French cooking when most Americans were smitten by the wonders of the new prepared foods in their markets. With unrelenting passion and precision, Olney studied and explored the cuisine, carefully documenting all he had learned for future generations of chefs, cooks, and food lovers. His first of several landmark works, THE FRENCH MENU COOKBOOK, was well ahead of its time with its authentic French recipes and then-unheard-of seasonal approach to cooking. Little did we know then that THE FRENCH MENU COOKBOOK would provide inspiration for Alice Waters and her compatriots as they built the groundwork for a culinary revolution in America. Brimming with the honest and enlightening explanations of how the French really cook and the 150-plus authentic recipes, this book is a masterful resource that is a must for every serious cook.</p><p>RICHARD OLNEY was born and raised in Iowa, one of eight children in a quintessential American family. After relocating to a Parisian suburb in 1951 and then buying a run-down property in Provence, Olney settled in France permanently. The author of eight books, Olney passed away at his Proven?ɬ�al home in the summer of 1999."Here's a blessing . . . and it's not in disguise." <br>&#x2014;<i>Newark Star Ledger</i><br><br>"The writer to whom Olney immediately demands comparison is Elizabeth David. The prose of each is characterized by an aesthetic sensibility enmeshed in the stabilizing regimen of a strictly imposed self-discipline." <br>&#x2014;John Thorne, author of <i>Pot on the Fire</i><br><br>"Richard Olney is someone who truly lives what he believes-cooking simply from the garden and drinking wonderful wines from the cellar. His FRENCH MENU COOKBOOK is an inspiration, giving a lasting insight into a special way of life." <br>&#x2014;Alice Waters</p><h2>Across the Universe - The DC Universe Stories of Alan Moore</h2><p>Collects stories written by Moore featuring superheroes including Superman, Batman, the Vigilante, Swamp Thing, and Green Arrow.</p><p>Alan Moore is one of the most respected and admired writers in comics today, with a host industry awards and accolades. His credits include The Ballad of Halo Jones, Watchmen, V For Vendetta, From Hell and Swamp Thing. He is currently working on his own line of comics, including Tom Strong, Promethea and The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen Volume 2.In the 1980s, while busy revolutionizing the superhero genre in <i>Watchmen</i> and <i>Swamp Thing</i>, comic-book writer Moore occasionally wrote scripts featuring other DC Comics characters, from its biggest stars to such obscure also-runs as the Vigilante and the Phantom Stranger. Most of the 13 such stories collected here are qualitatively several notches above run-of-the-mill, even if none approaches the lofty heights of Moore's more renowned work. Unable to give these stories' characters the wholesale overhauling for which he is famous, he relies more on imaginative plotting and incisive characterization. Outstanding are a pair of Superman tales, one also featuring Batman and Wonder Woman, and the other portraying an encounter with Moore's breakthrough character, Swamp Thing. It helps that those selections were drawn by the best artists on view here, Dave Gibbons, Moore's <i>Watchmen</i> collaborator, and Rick Veitch, who drew many of Moore's <i>Swamp Thing</i> scripts. If these stories amount to little more than an entertaining footnote to Moore's big hits, it is nice to have them gathered in one convenient volume. <i>Gordon Flagg</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

He has covered the Afghan mujahideen's war against the Soviets, and American military operations in Somalia, Haiti, Bosnia, Afghanistan, and Iraq. Named one of the 22 "unsung" influential print reporters in Washington by <i>American Journalism Review</i> in May 2002, he earned the White House Correspondents' Association's prestigious Edgar A. Poe Award for his coverage of Operation Anaconda.It was a raw, biting wind that swept down from the Hindu Kush in the first weeks of 2002, and the militiamen guarding the Ariana Hotel in downtown Kabul stamped their feet and blew on their hands to fight off the chill. <p>Behind them the hotel sat squat, yellow, and ugly. The Ariana was owned by the Afghan government, which in reality meant whichever guerrilla army happened to be in charge of Kabul at the time. It also meant the hotel had played several cameo roles in the decade of civil war that had wracked Afghanistan since the pro-Soviet government fell to the mujahideen in 1992. When the Taliban army of fundamentalist Muslim students routed the weak central government in 1996, their first order of business had been to drag Najibullah, the last pro-Soviet Afghan dictator, from the United Nations compound in which he and his brother had sheltered since their government fell in 1992. After torturing them, the Taliban death squad murdered the brothers and then hung their bodies from a makeshift scaffold in the traffic circle in front of the Ariana. Thereafter, the Taliban used the hotel as an R &amp; R spot for troops rotating back from the front line in the war against the Northern Alliance forces of Ahmad Shah Massoud, and as a way station for Pakistani volunteers en route to the front. By way of payback, a Northern Alliance jet dropped a bomb on the hotel in 1997.</p><p>Now the tables had turned again. Al Qaida, the Islamist terrorist organization that had found a welcoming home in Afghanistan under the Taliban, had hijacked four planes in the United States and flown two of them into the World Trade Center and one into the Pentagon, killing thousands and stirring the world&#x2019;s only superpower to action. The Americans had come to Afghanistan, embraced the Northern Alliance, and driven the Taliban from power. And so it was that the guards lounging by the large concrete steps that led up to the Ariana&#x2019;s main entrance were tough-looking Northern Alliance fighters, hard men down from the Panjshir Valley whose fingers never wandered far from the triggers of their Kalashnikov assault rifles. Some of these men had been fighting&#x2014;against the Soviets, Najibullah&#x2019;s regime, other mujahideen militias, and the Taliban&#x2014;for more than twenty years, and it showed on their dark, worn faces and dirty, calloused hands.</p><p>But the balance of power had not shifted completely in the Northern Alliance&#x2019;s favor. Not yet. The big dog on the block was the United States, and so while the Panjshiri guards shivered outside in their motley camouflage uniforms provided by the Central Intelligence Agency, inside the Ariana&#x2019;s bullet-scarred walls the Americans held court. The CIA had rented the entire hotel, retained the staff, and set up its Kabul station there. It made sense for the spooks to use the Ariana. It was centrally located, just a couple of blocks from the Presidential Palace, and the safe house being used by the Special Forces, but it was protected from the busy street by a ten-foot wall. The only other defenses the Americans had added were a string of concertina wire atop the wall and a sandbagged guard post on the flat roof, manned twenty-four hours a day by a couple of Northern Alliance fighters.</p><p>Easy living it wasn&#x2019;t. The plumbing was atrocious, even by Afghan standards, and the hotel was in a general state of disrepair. But it was warm, and the dining room still offered simple but delicious dishes of beans and rice and other staples of Afghan cuisine.</p><p>On this frigid mid-January afternoon a handful of men were gathered in one of the hotel&#x2019;s upstairs rooms for a meeting. The CIA personnel conducted most of their meetings in this room during those first turbulent months after the fall of Kabul, but on this occasion only one agency officer was present&#x2014;a thin, bearded man with long sandy hair called John, who was the deputy chief of station. The rest of the men were soldiers, special operators from the units that had been at the forefront of the war in Afghanistan. Like John, they were dressed in civilian clothes and wore their hair longer than most American soldiers are allowed. All sported the beards that were ubiquitous among American special operators and intelligence operatives in Afghanistan. Most were armed with M4 carbines or 9mm Beretta pistols.</p><p>It was a dark-walled room made even darker by the curtains drawn to prevent any snipers from drawing a bead on those inside. Dust motes swam in a single shaft of intense sunlight that exploited a small gap between the curtains. A lamp resting on an end table cast shadows on a floor covered by an Afghan rug, and the men sat on a tatty, overstuffed sofa and similarly worn but comfortable chairs.</p><p>As the Americans sipped green tea from a service that a member of the hotel staff had set on a glass-topped coffee table, the mood was businesslike. The Taliban had been defeated, the Northern Alliance had swept into Kabul, and the whole country was&#x2014;in theory&#x2014;under the control of the Americans and the Afghan warlords with whom they had allied themselves. But the men in the room were not celebrating. The Taliban were gone and Al Qaida&#x2019;s guerrillas were on the run, but there was still much to do. Six weeks earlier the Americans thought they had Al Qaida&#x2019;s leaders holed up at Tora Bora in the White Mountains that straddle the border with Pakistan. Reluctant to put too many American troops on the ground, U.S. commanders had relied on their Afghan allies backed up by Special Forces to snare Osama bin Laden and his henchmen. But this time the Americans&#x2019; faith in their militia allies was misplaced, and a failure to block escape routes into Pakistan from Tora Bora meant bin Laden and hundreds of Al Qaida&#x2019;s most hardened fighters had slipped the net.</p><p>So long as those guerrillas remained at large, the Americans knew they could not rest. And so as usual in these brainstorming sessions, which John convened daily in his excuse for a sitting room, the talk this afternoon was where to focus next.</p><p>As the meeting was breaking up, John looked across the table and spoke directly to one of the special operators&#x2014;an Army officer dressed in a thick, long-sleeved shirt with an Afghan scarf around his neck. Clipped into the waistband of his cargo pants was a black leather holster in which nestled a semiautomatic Glock pistol with a twenty-round extended clip. Over six feet tall with dark hair and a goatee that framed an open and honest face, the officer was forty years old, yet still had the lean, hard physique of the track and field champion he had been in his youth. He exuded the self-confident air of a man used to not just living but succeeding on his wits. His name was Pete Blaber and he was a lieutenant colonel in 1st Special Forces Operational Detachment&#x2014;Delta, better known to the public as &#x201c;Delta Force.&#x201d;</p><p>The agency was getting a lot of reports that Al Qaida forces were regrouping in a mountainous region south of Gardez in eastern Afghanistan&#x2019;s rugged Paktia province, John said. &#x201c;What&#x2019;s it called?&#x201d; Blaber asked. The CIA officer told him. Blaber, who had been in Afghanistan for a month and thought he knew the lay of the land, had never heard of the place. &#x201c;How do you spell it?&#x201d; he said, eyes narrowing with curiosity as he grabbed a mechanical pencil to jot the name down in his day planner.</p><p>As Blaber scribbled, the CIA officer spoke each letter in turn: &#x201c;S-H-A-H-I-K-H-O-T.&#x201d;</p></p><h2>The Poisoned Crown (The Accursed Kings)</h2><p>&#39;This was the original game of thrones&#39; George R.R.

He had just come from a long journey on foot and was exhausted, but that was not the cause of his tears. He wept because he could not prevent himself from departing on a trip when the need took him; he deserted family, work, and daily life to walk as fast as he could, straight ahead, sometimes doing 70 kilometers a day on foot, until in the end he would be arrested for vagrancy and thrown in prison."</p><p>&#x2015;Dr. Philippe Tissie, July 1886</p><p>Thus begins the recorded case history of Albert Dadas, a native of France's Bordeaux region and the first diagnosed mad traveler, or fuguer. An occasional employee of a local gas company, Dadas suffered from a strange compulsion that led him to travel obsessively, often without identification, not knowing who he was or why he traveled. He became notorious for his extraordinary expeditions to such far-reaching spots as Algeria, Moscow, and Constantinople. Medical reports of Dadas set off at the time of a small epidemic of compulsive mad voyagers, the epicenter of which was Bordeaux, but which soon spread throughout France to Italy, Germany, and Russia.</p><p>Today we are similarly besieged by mental illnesses of the moment, such as chronic fatigue syndrome and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. The debate rages about which of these conditions are affectations or cultural artifacts and which are "real." In Mad Travelers, Ian Hacking uses the Dadas case to weigh the legitimacy of cultural influences versus physical symptoms in the diagnosis of psychiatric disorders. He argues that psychological symptoms find stable homes at a given place and time, in "ecological niches" where transient illnesses flourish.</p><p>Using the records of Dadas's physician, Philippe Tissie, Hacking attempts to make sense of this strange epidemic. While telling his fascinating tale, he raises probing questions about the nature of mental disorders, the cultural repercussions of their diagnosis, and the relevance of this century-old case study for today's overanalyzed society.</p></p><p><p>Ian Hacking is Professor of Philosophy at the University of Toronto. He is the author of a number of books, most recently Rewriting the Soul.</p>The curious history of a now defunct Victorian-era psychiatric disorder is the jumping-off point for a reflection on the relationship between mental illness and its cultural context by Hacking, a philosopher who has written on the phenomenon of multiple personality disorder (Rewriting the Soul). In a series of four essays originally delivered as the 1997 Page-Barbour Lectures at the University of Virginia, Hacking closely analyzes the history of the dissociative fugue, a malady that enjoyed a brief vogue in the 1890s, particularly in France. Its symptom was compulsive bouts of walking in a state of complete forgetfulness of one's identity. The most celebrated fugueur was one Albert Dadas, a young gasworker from Bordeaux whose walks of up to 70 km a day took him as far afield as Algeria and Russia. By 1909, the disorder had all but vanished from the attention of the medical community, effaced by the demise of the hysteria diagnosis of which it was a subset. In this thoughtful but sometimes tiresomely discursive volume, Hacking analyzes the "ecological niche" that briefly allowed this illness and its diagnosis to flourish, combining details from the political and social contexts in which it was embedded along with excerpts from the doctor's chronicles of the Dadas case and anecdotes from medical history reaching from ancient Greece to the present. It would behoove us, Hacking writes, to think about how some of today's hot diagnoses?multiple personality disorder, PMS, ADD?might be equally niche-dependent. Yet, in his view, that would make them no less real. <br>Copyright 1998 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Apalache</h2><p>Designed and printed by Clifford Burke at the Cranium Press in San Francisco.

Adkins</strong> are both professional archaeologists. They have written numerous books together including <em>Dictionary of Roman Religion, An Introduction to Archaeology</em>, and <em>Handbook to Life in Ancient Rome</em>.<br>A follow-up to <i>Handbook to Life in Ancient Rome</i> (Facts On File, 1994) by the same authors, both professional archaeologists, this work adds to the publisher's ever-growing line of reasonably priced ready-reference works on history. According to the introduction, "the aim of this book is to present information relating to Greek history from the Minoan period to the Roman conquest"--a period from about 3000 B.C. to A.D. 30. Arranged thematically into 10 chapters with titles such as "Economy, Trade and Transport" and "Religion and Mythology," the work is then subdivided by topics pertinent to the chapter, with further subdivisions as needed. Each chapter ends with a list of bibliographic references, giving only author, year of publication, and often brief notes or specific page numbers. Complete bibliographic information for all sources cited in the work appears in a bibliography at the end of the volume. The bibliography includes book chapters and journal articles as well as monographic trade and university press publications, many of which were published in the 1990s. An index, which is a necessity in a work arranged like this, concludes the volume. The work is illustrated with some 100 photographs, 60 drawings, and 15 maps.<p>The thematic arrangement of this volume makes it very useful for anyone desiring a brief overview of a specific aspect of Greek life all in one place. The chapter "Military<i> </i>Affairs," for example, is divided into topics such as armies, soldiers, and training. In the section on soldiers are paragraph-length entries such as <i>Peltasts</i> (lightly armed<i> </i>infantry), <i>Helots </i>(serfs in the territory ruled by Sparta), and <i>Archers.</i> The section on battle tactic<i>s</i> includes <i>Phalanx</i>, <i>Hoplites</i>, and other topics. The arrangement makes for some repetition. <i>Hoplites, </i>a heavily armed infantry, also appears under <i>Soldiers</i>, although discussed from a somewhat different perspective.</p><p><i> </i>There is some overlap between this volume and another recently published Facts On File work, <i>Encyclopedia of the Ancient Greek World</i> by David Sacks [RBB N 1 95], particularly in biographical information and in mythology. Sacks' work, however, is arranged alphabetically, and coverage of certain topics is distinct enough to warrant having both works. The article <i>Pottery</i> in Sacks' volume is about 3 pages, while in the present work, discussion of pottery takes up some 10 pages. On the other hand, Sacks devotes more than 2 pages to an entry on homosexuality, while the present work covers it in less than half a page. Interestingly, Sacks' bibliography cites several primary sources, while the Adkins' volume does not. This work does, however, have an extremely useful 11-page table of place-names, first giving the anglicized version, then the ancient Greek version, then the modern place-name, and, finally, the country. For example, Troy is listed as <i>Troy/Illium</i> first, then <i>Ilion</i> for the ancient Greek version, and, finally, <i>Hisarlik</i> and <i>Turkey</i> for the final columns.</p><p>This will be a useful work for high-school, public, and academic libraries. Even libraries already owning the three-volume (also thematically arranged) <i>Civilization of the Ancient Mediterranean: Greece and Rome</i> [RBB Je 15 88] should consider this work, which will have a higher ready-reference value along with more recent scholarship. <i></i></p></p><h2>Bimini Twist: A Jane Bunker Mystery (A Jane Bunker Mystery, 4)</h2><p><p><b>Jane Bunker returns in <i>Bimini Twist</i>, another thrilling, small-town mystery by Linda Greenlaw set in Down East Maine.</b></p><p>It seems like everyone in Green Haven knows that Jane Bunker has scored an invite to the ultra-exclusive Summer Solstice Soiree&#x2015;and they all assume she&#x2019;ll be in attendance, as one of the few eligible single women in town.

When she gets to work one morning, the sheriff asks her to take a break on her personal war on drugs&#x2015;it seems that she&#x2019;s been so successful catching dealers and interrupting the flow of drugs in the area that she&#x2019;s called too much attention to just how bad it&#x2019;s gotten, and the community is worried that all the attention on the drug trade will deter the summer tourists that Green Haven so badly needs to keep the economy going. </p><p>Instead, Jane takes on a missing person case&#x2015;a young woman working at the Bar Harbor Inn has disappeared. The Inn employs foreign exchange students from all over the world during the busy summer season, and the missing Bianca Chiriac is one of them. When it becomes clear that Bianca isn&#x2019;t just sleeping off a late-night party, Jane is plunged into the underbelly of the resort town, and must find the missing woman before the worst happens.</p></p><p>LINDA GREENLAW is the author of the bestsellers <i>The Hungry Ocean</i>,<i> All Fishermen are Liars</i>, <i>The Lobster Chronicles</i>, and <i>Recipes from a Small Island</i>, as well as the Jane Bunker mysteries, including <i>Slipknot</i>, and <i>Fisherman&#x2019;s Bend</i>.

Learn about Irish history, culture, religion, laws, arts, antiquities, folklore, trade, literature, heroes, and more. Although a work of sound scholarship, it is as easy to read as a superb novel.</p><p>To understand modern Ireland one must understand the history of Ireland. Its legends, religious and political life, culture, and wider contributions to the world remain linked to its rich past. <p> In The Story of the Irish Race, popular writer and storyteller Seumas MacManus provides a wide-ranging look at the development of Ireland and its people. Beginning with the early colonization by the Milesius of Spain, MacManus explores ancient stories about the Tuatha De Danann, Cuchullain, Fionn and the Fian, Irish invasions of Britain, St. Bridget and St. Patrick, Irish missionaries and scholars abroad, and life and culture in ancient and medieval Ireland. He also investigates more recent events and names in Irish history, such as Oliver Cromwell, "The Wild Geese," Wolfe Tone, Daniel O'Connell, the Fenians, the Famine, Charles Stewart Parnell, and the Land League. From its earliest days to the Easter Rising, MacManus provides an entertaining and enlightening look at one of the most fascinating cultures we know.</p>SEUMAS MacMANUS was a prolific Donegal-based author who published a number of books in the U.S., including Donegal Fairy Stories, In Chimney-Corners, The Donegal Wonder-Book, The Well o' the World's End, and A Lad of the O'Friels.

Reprint. 12,500 first printing.</p><p>Napoleon Bonaparte was a bully, rude and insulting. Women did not like him. But even so, writes Frank McLynn, "he had an amazing ability to sway other men to his purposes," which earned him one of the greatest empires Europe had ever known. McLynn, a noted biographer of difficult personalities, gives us a many-sided Napoleon: the shrewd strategist, the intolerant prude, the scrappy fighter, the charismatic leader, the sadist. ("He liked to strike people of both sexes, to slap them, pull their hair, pinch their ears and tweak their noses.") He nonetheless managed to extend French rule to the gates of Moscow. Why, then, was he so resoundingly defeated? McLynn argues that, among other things, Napoleon was not ruthless enough in dealing with the "endless list of ingrates" that surrounded him.<p> McLynn's book has several virtues, and readers interested in Napoleon's brief but brilliant career will want to have a look. <i>--Gregory McNamee</i></p><strong>Frank McLynn</strong> has over twenty books to his name, including his acclaimed biographies of Napoleon and Richard the Lionhearted. His other books include <em>Richard and John: Kings at War</em>; <em>Villa and Zapata</em>; <em>1066</em>; <em>Heroes &amp; Villains; and Napoleon: A Biography</em>.

He lives in London.</p><h2>Freud</h2><p><strong>Unflinching truth</strong> &nbsp; British artist <strong>Lucian Freud</strong>&nbsp;(1922&#x2013;2011) was widely considered the most important figurative painter of his generation. Master portraitist and specialist in nudes, Freud used impasto to create depth and intensity while restraining his color palate to mostly muted hues. His portraits may be physically unflattering to their subjects, but they are honest, frank, and unapologetic. "I paint people," Freud said, "not because of what they are like, not exactly in spite of what they are like, but how they happen to be." &nbsp; <strong>About the Series:</strong><br> Each book in TASCHEN&#x2019;s Basic Art series features: <ul> <li> a detailed chronological summary of the life and oeuvre of the artist, covering his or her cultural and historical importance </li> <li> a concise biography </li> <li> approximately 100 illustrations with explanatory captions </li> </ul></p><p>Sebastian Smee is art critic at the Boston Globe.

He has contributed essays to several books on Lucian Freud, and his articles have been published in The Daily Telegraph, The Guardian and The Spectator.</p><h2>Victory (Volume 11) (Kydd Sea Adventures, 11)</h2><p>In the 11th book of this popular series, Napoleon Bonaparte continues planning for the invasion of England as Admiral Horatio Nelson and the Royal Navy patrol the seas, seeking out their elusive enemy. When convoluted political machinations in England lead to the impeachment of the head of the Navy, Commander Thomas Kydd is forced to choose sides. Eager to take on the real enemy, Kydd decides to join Nelson&#39;s squadron just before the Battle of Trafalgar, the greatest sea encounter of all time. Amidst the chaos and bloodshed, Kydd and his shipmates must prove once and for all that the Royal Navy truly rules the seas.</p><p>Julian Stockwin is a retired lieutenant commander of the Royal Navy Reserve. He entered the British Navy at age 15 and was eventually named a Member of the British Empire. He is the author of the Kydd Sea Adventures series.The sails are mostly slack in Stockwin's latest Thomas Kydd sea adventure. It's 1805, and as the British prepare for Napoleon's expected invasion of England, Kydd, a rising star in the Royal Navy, is given command of a frigate and ordered to join admiral Lord Horatio Nelson's forces in the Mediterranean. Much of the story is taken up with historical naval activity such as the British blockade of French ports and Nelson's pursuit of the French fleet across the Atlantic and back, with all of the sailing leading up to the Battle of Trafalgar, where the British defeat the combined French and Spanish fleets. Unfortunately, Kydd plays no part in the epic sea battle. In fact, Kydd and his ship spend most of this tale patrolling and carrying messages between fleets. Stockwin is a master of vivid, accurate narratives of seamanship and Napoleonic era naval warfare, but the lack of suspense and uneven bouts of action leave this series installment feeling limp. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Twenty-five years ago I founded The Gateway Rehabilitation System in Pittsburgh. I am often asked whether any particular treatment modality is employed at Gateway. I always answer that our strength lies in our belief in the inherent goodness of every client. This quality is not always easy to recognize in a person who has led a destructive lifestyle for decades, someone whose use of alcohol or drugs has caused great suffering for others. But in all my years of treating illnesses of the heart and soul, this belief has never failed me; each individual's integrity is always there, lurking right beneath the surface, eager to emerge. </p> <p>A story occurs to me of a man named Avi. I first met him while I was in Tel Aviv speaking before a group of ex-convicts in recovery who were coming into our Israeli rehabilitation program, a sister home to Gateway. When I began to speak of self-esteem, this man interrupted me. "How can you talk to us of this? I've been a thief since I was eight. When I'm out of prison I can't find work and my family doesn't want to see me." </p> <p>I stopped him and asked if he'd passed by a jewelry store lately. "Consider the diamonds in the window," I said. "Try and think what they look like when they come out of the mine as lumps of dirty stone. It takes a person who understands the diamond to take the shapeless mound and bring out its intrinsic beauty. That's what we do here: We look for the diamond in everyone; we help the soul's beauty come to the surface; we polish it until it gleams." I looked at Avi, all disheveled and hunched over, nearly hiding in his seat, and said, "You're like that dirt-covered stone. Our business is to find the diamond within and polish it until it glows." </p> <p>Two years passed. Avi had graduated from the treatment center, and when the following event took place he had already completed his stay in the halfway house and was integrated into the community, working in construction. One day Annette, who manages the halfway house, received a call from a family whose elderly matriarch had died. They wanted to donate her furniture to the halfway house. Annette called Avi and asked him to pick up the furniture, which he willingly agreed to do. When he went to pick it up, he saw that it wasn't worth saving, but not wanting to insult the family, he hauled it anyway. </p> <p> While Avi was laboring to carry the shabby sofa up the stairs to the halfway house, an envelope fell from the cushions. After getting the couch inside, Avi retrieved the envelope, in which he found five thousand shekels (about $1,700). Now Avi, remember, had served time in prison for burglary. When he was doing drugs he would have broken into a home for twenty dollars. But now Avi called Annette and told her about the envelope. Annette said it must be reported to the family. </p> <p>The family was so gratified by Annette's and Avi's honesty that they told her to keep the money for the halfway house. As a result, the halfway house was able to buy one more bed and provide room for one more guest, creating another opportunity for recovery. And Avi wasn't a crook anymore. </p> <p>Avi relayed this story to me in a letter. He wrote, "When I used drugs, I would get a high for a very short time. When the high wore off I felt terrible, worse than before. It's been three months since I found that money and every time I think of what I did, I feel good all over again. How different a feeling than a temporary fix." </p> <p>Another year went by and I returned to the halfway house where Avi's good deed had set off a chain of events which led to, among other things, an extra bed. There was a sign hanging above the entry. It read: DIAMONDS POLISHED HERE. </p> <p><b>�Rabbi Abraham J. Twerski, M.D</b>. </p> <p><b>We Are All Jews Now </b> </p> <p><i>The highest flights of charity, devotion, trust, patience, bravery, to which the wings of human nature have spread themselves have been flown for religious ideas. </i> </p> <blockquote> <blockquote> <p><b>�William James </b> </p> </blockquote> </blockquote> <p>Viewed from high on the rimrock cliffs that run along the northern edge of Billings, Montana, the city presents an attractive sight, a thriving metropolis nestled within the great open spaces of the American West. Citizens of Billings say it's a good, civilized place to live. They pride themselves on the quality of their schools and their strong family values. </p> <p>So it came as a shock to many when, in November 1995, a series of hate crimes took place against minority groups in the city. </p> <p>Whoever was responsible for these acts must have thought that their victims would be easy targets. Billings is predominantly white; Native Americans, African-Americans and Jews make up only a small percentage of the population. But there are just enough of them to frighten and harass�or so the haters must have thought. </p> <p>They mounted a series of nasty attacks. Graves were overturned in a Jewish cemetery. Offensive words and a swastika were scrawled on the house of a Native-American woman. People worshipping at a black church were intimidated. A brick was heaved through the window of a Jewish child who was displaying a menorah in her window. </p> <p> But the white supremacists, or whoever they were, had reckoned without the </p> <p>citizens of Billings, who had an answer for them�and it wasn't what the hate-mongers were expecting. An alliance quickly emerged, spearheaded by churches, labor unions, the media and hundreds of local citizens. </p> <p>The results were dramatic. Attendance at the black church rose steadily. People of many different ethnic backgrounds and faiths began to attend services there. Their message was clear: "We may all be different, but we are also one. Threaten any one of us and you threaten us all." </p> <p>A similar spirit propelled volunteers to come together and repaint the house of Dawn Fast Horse, the Native-American woman. This happened at amazing speed. Dawn had awoken one morning to see that her house had been defaced. By the evening, after two hundred people showed up to help, the house had been repainted. </p> <p>When it came to the incident of the brick being thrown through the window of the Jewish child, an interfaith group quickly had a creative idea. They recalled the example of the Danes during World War II. When the occupying Nazis proclaimed that all Jews must wear the yellow Star of David, the King of Denmark appeared in public wearing one, too. And so did many other Danes. </p> <p>So the people of Billings got organized, and a campaign began. Everyone pitched in, including the local newspaper, which printed a Hanukkah page, including a full-color representation of a menorah. Thousands of Billings residents cut out the paper menorah and displayed it in their windows. By late December, driving around Billings was a remarkable experience. Nearly ten thousand people were displaying those paper menorahs in their windows, and the menorahs remained in place throughout the eight days of Hanukkah. It was a brilliant answer to the hate-mongers. A town that had few Jews was saying with one collective voice, "We are all Jews now." </p></p><h2>Against Sadomasochism: A Radical Feminist Analysis</h2><p>A 1982 radical feminist anthology edited by Robin Ruth Linden, Darlene R.

Well, they do, and here their dogs are, holding forth (thanks to editors Hempel and Shepard's groupings of their efforts) on such subjects of canine contemplation as "Chow," "The Good Life," "Substance Abuse," and "Theology" (Kathryn Walker's Flea posits a Big Dog creator; Mark Doty's Beau practices Zen). Some of these pups are even able to address us from the grave, including the inevitable nonconformist, John Irving's Marrow, who opines that "All dogs prefer prose." Tricked out with more than a few dual-author portraits (pick of the pack--Andrew Hudgins and Rosie, giving good tongue), this is as endearing and amusing--as earthy, too--as poetry collections get. <i>Ray Olson</i></p><h2>The Best of Enemies: Race and Redemption in the New South</h2><p>Describes how C.P. Ellis, a member of the Ku Klux Klan, and Ann Atwater, an African American civil rights activist, overcame racial divisions to forge a strong friendship</p><p>"For eighty years we've waited for a reply to <i>Birth of a Nation</i>. At last Osha Gray Davidson has done the job. The story of C. P. Ellis, Exalted Cyclops of the Ku Klux Klan of Durham, North Carolina, and of Ann Atwater, a black civil rights advocate, his enemy for so many years, is one of the most moving love stories I've ever come across. More than that, in a time of bleakness, it sounds a note of hope. <i>The Best of Enemies</i> is a glorious work."--Studs Terkel <br>Claiborne Paul Ellis, known to all as &#34;C.P.&#34;, grew up in the &#34;poor white&#34; section of Durham, North Carolina, just north of the railroad tracks that marked the boundary between the white and black neighborhoods. Surrounded by poverty and affected early by a pervasive racism, C.P. devoured the tales his father told him of the secret, all-white society that would save Dixie, and as a young man he joined the Ku Klux Klan. In 1955, Ann Atwater was employed as a domestic servant when the ripples from the Montgomery bus boycotts hit Durham. Incensed by a racist remark made by her employer, Ann quit her job to join the civil rights fight. During the 1960s, as the country struggled with the explosive issues of race and class, Ann met C.P. on opposite sides of the public school integration issue. Their encounters were charged with hatred and suspicion. Gradually, though, Ann and C.P. each came to see how the other had been exploited by the South&#39;s rigid power structure, and they forged a friendship that even today flourishes against a background of renewed bigotry. In our racially divisive times, Osha Gray Davidson gives us a vivid portrait of a friendship that defied all odds. And with characteristic skill and elan he probes one of the most crucial concerns at the heart of our culture: how and why race is a potentially destructive force. The Best of Enemies weaves rich history with an inspiring personal saga to depict the triumph of the human spirit over the tragic past.</p><h2>Fanny Brice: The Original Funny Girl</h2><p>"I've done everything in the theatre except marry a property man," Fanny Brice once boasted. "I've acted for Belasco and I've laid 'em out in the rows at the Palace. I've doubled as an alligator; I've worked for the Shuberts; and I've been joined to Billy Rose in the holy bonds. I've painted the house boards and I've sold tickets and I've been fired by George M. Cohan. I've played in London before the king and in Oil City before miners with lanterns in their caps." Fanny Brice was indeed show business personified, and in this luminous volume, Herbert G. Goldman, acclaimed biographer of Al Jolson, illuminates the life of the woman who inspired the spectacularly successful Broadway show and movie <em>Funny Girl</em>, the vehicle that catapulted Barbra Streisand to super stardom. <br> In a work that is both glorious biography and captivating theatre history, Goldman illuminates both Fanny's remarkable career on stage and radio--ranging from her first triumph as "Sadie Salome" to her long run as radio's "Baby Snooks"--and her less-than-triumphant personal life. He reveals a woman who was a curious mix of elegance and earthiness, of high and low class, a lady who lived like a duchess but cursed like a sailor. She was probably the greatest comedienne the American stage has ever known as well as our first truly great torch singer, the star of some of the most memorable <em>Ziegfeld Follies</em> in the 1910s and 1920s, and Goldman covers her theatrical career and theatre world in vivid detail. But her personal life, as Goldman shows, was less successful. The great love of her life, the gangster Nick Arnstein, was dashing, handsome, sophisticated, but at bottom, a loser who failed at everything from running a shirt hospital to manufacturing fire extinguishers, and who spent a good part of their marriage either hiding out, awaiting trial, or in prison. Her first marriage was over almost as soon as it was consummated, and her third and last marriage, to Billy Rose, the "Bantam Barnum," ended acrimoniously when Rose left her for swimmer Eleanor Holm. As she herself remarked, "I never liked the men I loved, and I never loved the men I liked." Through it all, she remained unaffected, intelligent, independent, and, above all, honest.<br> Goldman's biography of Al Jolson has been hailed by critics, fellow biographers, and entertainers alike. Steve Allen called it "an amazing job of research" and added "Goldman's book brings Jolson back to life indeed." <em>The Philadelphia Inquirer</em> said it was "the most comprehensive biography to date," and Ronald J. Fields wrote that "Goldman has captured not only the wonderful feel of Al Jolson but the heartbeat of his time." Now, with <em>Fanny Brice</em>, Goldman provides an equally accomplished portrait of the greatest woman entertainer of that illustrious era, a volume that will delight every lover of the stage.</p><p><br><em>About the Author:</em><br> <strong>Herbert G. Goldman</strong> is a free-lance writer who lives in New York City. He is currently working on a biography of Eddie Cantor.<br>Well-written life of the great comedienne, today known best as the original of Barbra Streisand's Funny Girl and Funny Woman; by the author of 1988's well-received Jolson. Goldman, an intense researcher, caps his present bio with a big stageography-filmography-discography-bibliography. Brice (1891- 1951) has had only one previous biography, 1952's The Fabulous Fanny by Norman Katkov, which was adapted from her own unpublished memoirs and had little to say about her career. Aside from Streisand's misleading musical film-bios, she is semi-forgotten and remembered largely for her radio shows as Baby Snooks. But in many ways, her life holds tremendous fascination, and the present work hasn't a dull moment. Brice, born Borach on New York's Lower East Side, showed early comic talents, began earning $30 a week as a kid by winning amateur contests all over Brooklyn and Manhattan and playing in light stage-shows. She grew professionally in vaudeville and burlesque, moving from chorus girl to singer-dancer, was a knockout at Yiddish dialect or throwaway lines of Brooklynese (which Streisand captured perfectly). Then, at only 19, she landed in Ziegfeld's Follies for 1910 and thereafter was featured in every edition but two until 1923. As a singer she could thrill audiences, much like Al Jolson or the later Judy Garland, while her genius for comedy, as in her mock ballet ``The Dying Duck,'' melted them into salty puddles of hysteria. Her fame grew exponentially when her first husband, con man Nick Arnstein, was jailed and later became a world-famous fugitive. His selfishness finally killed the marriage, and Fanny later married impresario Billy Rose, another failed union. Her great hit, a closed-eyes rendition of ``My Man,'' was not the show-stopper of Funny Girl: audiences at the real thing were too wiped out for a huge response. A celebrity bio the way they should be written. -- <i>Copyright �1992, Kirkus Associates, LP.

Mortimer (author of Rumpole of the Bailey and a writer for the television series Brideshead Revisted ) has blended elements of social satire and mystery into an entertaining story whose atmosphere of mounting tension culminates in a disturbing climax.

This can lead individuals to memorialize past sufferings through psychological symptoms and compulsive repetitions. Dr. Shabad discusses how patients, after many years of living a life limited by resentment, fear, and despair, can come to terms with their childhood experiences: a mother who can never be satisfied, a father who consistently buries his head in the newspaper. He explains how people can overcome hardships endured and losses suffered. The authentic spontaneous dialogue between therapist and patient provides the generosity and courage necessary to shed their now obsolete defenses and mourn what cannot be remedied or replaced. Rich clinical material demonstrates how mourning can bring about self-acceptance, and set individuals free to take responsibility for and live out their own personal truths. This is a deeply felt, and beautifully written tribute to the redemptive power of psychotherapy and to the regenerative capabilities in all human beings.</p><p><b>Peter Shabad, Ph.D.</b> is currently an Assistant Professor of Clinical Psychiatry at Northwestern University Medical School. He teaches, supervises, and maintains a private practice in Chicago.Peter Shabad's remarkable new book reminds us of the reach and the resonance of the language of psychoanalysis at its best. His subject, in a sense, is the retreat from sociability; and his descriptions of what he calls the 'desperate morality of survival,' of the ways in which the troubled person cures himself by segregating his experience and then can't find a cure for his self cure, are among the most powerful in contemporary psychoanalysis. This is a book not merely for psychoanalysts, but for anyone interested in the roots of contemporary morality. (Adam Phillips, author of Promises, Promises)<br><br>Peter Shabad has written a book of large achievement. <i>Despair and the Return of Hope</i> is bound to usher in a new epoch in clinical discussions and debates about the problem of adapting to the facts of life. There are many reasons to applaud the author's accomplishments. I especially like his original clinical views on disillusionment (deep-seated negative illusions) and mourning (as distinguished from grief), and the refreshing ways he articulates complex ideas. Dr. Shabad walks comfortably and judiciously through the terrains of psychology, literature, philosophy, and popular culture. Mental health professionals will be impressed with his numerous and elegant clinical examples and his call for the use of the personal in psychotherapy. His treatise has broadened and deepened the therapeutic message. Dr. Shabad has written a book that sparkles with creativity as it scrutinizes the face of death. (Spyros D. Orfanos, Ph.D., ABPP, Manhattan Institute for Psychoanalysis; Stephen A. Mitchell Center for Relational Psychoanalysis)<br><br>With <i>Despair and the Return of Hope</i>, Dr. Peter Shabad has masterfully crafted a richly textured, beautifully elegant work of art, a masterpiece that represents the culmination of years of clinical work and theoretical study. In a book that is at once inspired, inspiring, and poetic, Dr. Shabad has managed seamlessly to integrate the psychoanalytic and the existential. The result is a riveting volume whose pages are replete with clinically useful pearls of wisdom about life, death, and much that is in between. This is ultimately a story about transformation, forgiveness, and letting go; the development of the capacity to 'choose oneself' as one moves from disillusionment, hopelessness, and despair to freedom, hopefulness, and possibility. A must-read that you won't be able to put down until you've read every last word.

This joint initiative of Churchill and de Gaulle - codename &#34;Operation Exporter&#34; - led to one of the most shocking conflicts of World War II. Was this an attempt by the Allied forces to cause mass desertions from the Vichy forces to the Free French? Or were Churchill and de Gaulle motivated to reassert their respective control of the Middle East? The fight caused the loss of 10,000 lives, numerous ships and an estimated 200 aircraft. The Australian forces, under the command of Lieutenant General John Lavarack, carried out the bulk of the fighting and suffered the most casualties. The Vichy Army was overcome, but even during the bitter campaign, the Free French airmen refused to fire on their Vichy compatriots. Henri de Wailly here presents the story of this extraordinary campaign by the British, Australian and Free French forces against Vichy French forces in Syria and Lebanon, the true extent of which has largely been forgotten.</p><p>A graduate of the Sydney University Medical School, William Land holds an M.Litt from the University of New England and a PhD from the Department of French Studies of the University of Sydney.

A master of disguise, he makes his living stalking harbors, coffeehouses, and print shops for the latest manuscript to steal. But this golden age of publishing is on the verge of collapse. For a hundred years, loose copyright laws and a hungry reading public created a unique opportunity: books could easily be published without an author&#x2019;s permission. Authors gained fame but suffered financially&#x2014;Charles Dickens, Mark Twain, Robert Louis Stevenson, to name a few&#x2014;but publishers reaped enormous profits while readers bought books inexpensively. Yet on the eve of the twentieth century, a new international treaty is signed to grind this literary underground to a sharp halt. The bookaneers are on the verge of extinction.<br><br>From the author of <i>The Dante Club</i>, Matthew Pearl, <i>The Last Bookaneer </i>is the astonishing story of these literary thieves&#x2019; epic final heist. On the island of Samoa, a dying Robert Louis Stevenson labors over a new novel. The thought of one last book from the great author fires the imaginations of the bookaneers, and soon Davenport sets out for the South Pacific island. As always, Davenport is reluctantly accompanied by his assistant Fergins, who is whisked across the world for one final caper. Fergins soon discovers the supreme thrill of aiding Davenport in his quest to steal Stevenson&#x2019;s manuscript and make a fortune before the new treaty ends the bookaneers&#x2019; trade forever. But Davenport is hardly the only bookaneer with a mind to pirate Stevenson&#x2019;s last novel. His longtime adversary, the monstrous Belial, appears on the island, and soon Davenport, Fergins, and Belial find themselves embroiled in a conflict larger, perhaps, than literature itself.<br><br>In T<i>he Last Bookanee</i>r, Pearl crafts a finely wrought tale about a showdown between brilliant men in the last great act of their professions.

C. Fergins</b><br><br>Back in my salad days laboring for the New York Central and Hudson River Railroad Company, I would always keep an eye out to see if he would enter our car before the hour of departure. &#x201c;Expecting some pretty lass, are we?&#x201d; the cook, grumbling with sarcasm, would ask me as I was scrubbing a table or polishing silverware to a blinding shine.<br> &nbsp;<br> The man I would look for was given no more attention inside the cars than the bootblack or the traveling baker balancing his bread tray over his long arms. I suppose most people probably never looked at him long enough to take in his appearance. Middle-aged, middle-height, shaped like a plum, he had white metal-rim spectacles and a sharp nose and chin. His substantial and intelligent mouth was always busily readying itself for a smile, a song, or a whistle, or a shape of surprise. He would maneuver his bulky cart down the aisle of the train, a striped umbrella and his soft felt hat tucked above the top shelf of books. Reaching our dining car, he would push his bright green cart to me. Both of us had found the only man on the train who appreciated the<br> other.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;My favorite customer,&#x201d; he would cheer me on; then, leaning so far over his cart it might tip over: &#x201c;What catches your fancy today, Mr. Clover?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> My fellow dining car waiters liked to read novels about poor boys who become rich, or rich men who were secretly criminals. They turned the pages so rapidly the words were scenery, like the fields and farms that passed our windows for long stretches at a time. I was looking for something else in books. I could not really say what, but I think I can say why: a notion started in my own brain was probably wrong, but an answer read in a work of literature would be right. That was my conviction at nineteen, and only in later years would I come to trust myself over a book.<br> &nbsp;<br> Despite Mr. Fergins&#x2019;s kind words, I did not really qualify as a customer. My pockets were so empty I was the only one living in New York City who did not fear thieves. But the generous old bookseller would leave me a book of my choice before continuing through the cars. If the tables were cleaned and set early, I could read until I felt the floorboards shake underfoot with the rumble of the engine. Then I&#x2019;d hurry to return the borrowed volume while helping to carry his cart off the train. As he stood on the platform when the train began to run, Mr. Fergins waved his handkerchief as if he were seeing off his son.<br> &nbsp;<br> In the village where I was born we did not have the variety of books that is only made possible by a bookstore or a circulating library. The local minister would give my mother books for me to read&#x2014;black, thick, drab volumes meant to educate in menial or spiritual ways. Literature? I hardly even knew the word. My eyes were opened by an old, weathered copy of Milton I found when I was thirteen and the minister invited me to use his library. The poem was religious, but there was something new about it. The stories that I had heard so often in sermons were transformed by the poetry. They were made flesh and bone. It seemed I felt the tingling breath of Lucifer on the back of my neck, the light touch of Eve grazing against my arm, the expulsion not only of our first parents but of all the provincial boredom of my life. I cannot recall what questions I asked about <i>Paradise Lost</i>, but it must have been clear to him I was interested in the poetry over doctrine, because the book disappeared. Five years later, when I accepted the first job that brought me away from country life, I think I knew however much I tried I would never truly feel at home in mammoth, steamfilled Manhattan, with its incessant gallop, but the books consoled me.They were everywhere you looked, in the front of shop windows, displayed on tables along the sidewalks, in brand-new public libraries as big as castles. Even inside train cars.<br> &nbsp;<br> Mr. Fergins may have been uninteresting to others. A relic of a time much slower than 1891; to them, he was as ordinary as his clothes. But they could not see the real man: amiable and unassuming, humble; there was a meaningful quality to his reticence, something unspoken.<br> He endured the usual rudeness and impatience faced by salesmen. Perhaps this explained his patience toward me. Just as he would never dismiss the tastes of the waiters who wanted their fill of &#x201c;sensation books,&#x201d; he never questioned my worthiness for steeper paths. Books could function in two different ways, he told me one time. &#x201c;They can lull us as would a dream, or they could change us, atom by atom, until we are closer to God. One way is passive, the other animating&#x2014;both worthy.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I am just a railway waiter,&#x201d; I said once while lifting his cart down from the train. &#x201c;No book in the world will change that.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> He gave such a friendly, all-consuming laugh that I found myself laughing without wanting to, my heart sinking to the bottom of my chest as my eyes fell to the tulips painted on the cart. I suppose I&#x2019;d hoped he&#x2019;d argue.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Forgive me, my young Mr. Clover. I laugh only at your formula. Literature will not change our profession or the quality of hats on our heads, heaven forbid&#x2014;by change, I mean another thing entirely.&#x201d; He fiddled with his white spectacles. &#x201c;Another thing . . .&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> ***<br> But he did not finish speaking before the engine began to run and drowned him out.<br> &nbsp;<br> Being a railway waiter means standing in place while the world moves around you. Because of us, instead of noticing that they had trapped themselves inside the belly of one of the most remarkable mechanical inventions of modern times, moving at speeds never before achieved, travelers could pretend that they were sitting in a dining room similar to their own. One evening around seven o&#x2019;clock, on a popular route, our dining car teemed with people. There were frequently men and women of distinguished character, wealthy, well known, respected. On this occasion, there was a table on the far end of the car attracting stares that turned into stage whispers. I was too busy with my passengers to pay attention until Rapp, the waiter assigned to the table, grabbed my elbow. His skin was darker than mine, and he had greasy hair and a slight mustache waxed into crude points at each end, in imitation of our head cook.<br> &nbsp;<br> He said: &#x201c;You&#x2019;re a bookworm, Clover.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;What about it?&#x201d; I was in no mood for his teasing.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;No offense. Sensitive one, you are. Just that I&#x2019;ve noticed that grim half-breed face of yours perks up when you&#x2019;re talking to that queer peddler.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Rapp was just as much a half-breed as I was, as were all the railway k then, but I was more annoyed by how he spoke about my friend. &#x201c;Mr. Fergins is no peddler.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Rambles through the cars hawking books, don&#x2019;t he? Ain&#x2019;t that a peddler? Besides, that ain&#x2019;t what I wanted to say. Thought you&#x2019;d fancy a look.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> He gestured with a nod toward the table. There was a passenger, back facing me, his hair worn long with strands of white and silver. He sat at a forward angle over his meal of boiled leg of mutton with Parisienne potatoes as though he were driving a team of horses.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Mark Twain&#x2014;Twain, the writer. Don&#x2019;t you even know about the things you know about?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> I had never seen an author in the f lesh. I had never <i>considered </i>seeing an author in the f lesh long enough to think what I would do. Rapp&#x2019;s half of the car remained busy, but my tables had begun to clear, and the chief cook called me over to help. After I was charged with a smoking tray of food for one of my tables, the cook opened the ice chest in the floor and pulled out a bottle of wine. It was for table sixteen. <br> &nbsp;<br> I took a few deep breaths and crossed to Rapp&#x2019;s side, where I turned to face one of my favorite authors, a half-dozen witty and clever sayings at the tip of my tongue. From under a wig of silver hair, a frightful old woman looked back up at me, f licking her long tongue over the white blur of her false teeth. &#x201c;Heavens, what are you standing there for?&#x201d; exclaimed the lady. &#x201c;You can see I&#x2019;m thirsty, boy. What kind of waiter are you?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> My hands moist with hot sweat, the bottle slipped through my fingers. Shattered glass and splattered wine: the greatest fear of the railway waiter. All the occupants of the dining car were gaping at me and it seemed every last one joined Rapp&#x2019;s laughter. <br> &nbsp;<br> I could not bring myself to tell Mr. Fergins what had happened. A few days later, he was rolling his books through our cars and calling out his newest titles. I still felt the sharp sting of humiliation. Even minor embarrassment lingered a long time with me. I fell off a horse when I was seven years old, and some mornings in New York City, waking on my hard cot in a closet-like room, the shrill laughter of my former playmates rang in my ears.<br> &nbsp;<br> The bookseller must have heard something of the practical joke, because he spoke to me in such a way that he might have been visiting my sickbed.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;There is no keeping a secret on a train,&#x201d; I said, my eyes falling to my hands. <br> &nbsp;<br> He tried an innocent smile, then frowned at himself for giving himself away. &#x201c;Come. Any man could drop something on a moving train.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;One of the other waiters played a dirty trick. Said Mark Twain was in the dining car, and I believed it. I stupidly believed it.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;No, but Twain wouldn&#x2019;t be traveling that route this time of year,&#x201d; he began, then stopped himself, excusing the strange digression by clearing his throat. &#x201c;Mr. Clover, you believed your unworthy associate&#x2019;s statement because you are an honest man, and you expect honesty reflected back from the world. I have been known to be the same way.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;The worst part, Mr. Fergins, was not Rapp&#x2019;s joke. It was how I felt when I saw it was not really him.&#x201d; As I finished the statement, I realized with shame that there were tears in my eyes.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;You are always better off to read a book, anyway, than to meet the person behind it.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Why?&#x201d; I asked of the peculiar reassurance. By the time he held out his handkerchief I had forgotten my own question. <br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Do you know why you are so upset?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t, sir,&#x201d; I admitted.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Let us think about it. Maybe it will come to you.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;No. I haven&#x2019;t a clue why I have turned into such a baby over a silly prank, some broken glass, and an author who was never there to begin with. New York City is too hard, just as Reverend Millens warned.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Millens?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;My father,&#x201d; I explained, telling the bookseller more in two words than I would ever reveal to the other waiters or the fellows in my tenement. &#x201c;Well, I never knew he was, until I was thirteen. His church helped bring my mother to the village when she was a girl during the war, and then she assisted him in the work of arranging for others to come there. We could not be in his congregation, of course, but he would leave me books when I was a boy and, later, would let me pick them for myself. Sometimes I could hear his sermons from inside the library, which was above the chapel. When I told him I wanted to leave, he warned me the city would be too much for me, that it would be hard enough for a white man.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;New York is hard for everybody; that is what makes it what it is. You know, Mr. Clover, when most people read a book, they take from its story happiness and strife, good and evil, morality and sin, so on and so on. That is not what is most important. It is always in the parts that we cannot fully understand&#x2014;the holes in a story, the piece missing&#x2014;where the real truth of the thing lurks.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> I shrugged, not seeing the point.<br><br> &#x201c;There may come a day when you will understand what you are grieving today. Then the story you just told about Mr. Rapp&#x2019;s loathsome prank will have another meaning, and be more important to you than an actual encounter with a so-called genius. Then you will think back and say, &#x2018;Mr. Fergins was a true friend.&#x2019;&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> He seemed to guess I was most concerned at the moment about whether he would judge me for crying; he patted my arm reassuringly, which helped, and I sat back and listened to his wonderful descriptions of the latest books, as if he were offering up new and better lives. He even read me part of Coleridge&#x2019;s &#x201c;The Rime of the Ancient Mariner,&#x201d; with all its stormy rhythms. <i>We were the first that ever burst</i>&#x2014;as I listened, I felt as though his words were the winds and they were driving us on&#x2014;<i>into that silent sea</i>. In later years, this would be one of my happiest memories of my time as a railroad man.<br> &nbsp;<br> New York City was so expensive that on only six or seven dollars a week (depending on gratuities) my chief amusement besides reading had to be to walk the island from end to end and watch. Watch the wealthy families stepping up into extravagant four-horse chariots, watch the vendors in the crowded quarters of hardworking Chinese or Germans. Everyone, the wealthiest or poorest, seemed to be in a hurry, but not I, not when I was away from the railroad. My mother&#x2019;s cousin had a stable for police horses, so I saw him once every few months, but mostly he would have me help tend to the horses. From time to time I would encounter the bookseller in the city. I was so accustomed to seeing Mr. Fergins on his rounds through our train, I marveled the first time I saw the man with the roar of the city around him&#x2014;but there he was, bent over his green cart, pushing it through the streets as though he had done so for all eternity. On one particular day, I was passing through the uneven streets of the lower portion of the city, studded with mansions of bygone eras that had turned into warehouses as the wealthy were building estates closer to the park. It was growing late, the brick buildings tinted a peaceful orange by the sun, when he appeared, struggling over the dents and breaks in the sidewalk. I rushed to help.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;My poor legs rejoice for you, young Clover,&#x201d; he said, his face wet and pink with effort. &#x201c;I purchased this cart from a florist&#x2014;that is why there are tulips painted on one side&#x2014;and sometimes I think of what it would be like filled with bouquets. Nothing in the world&#x2014;not a ton of bricks&#x2014;feels as heavy as books being moved.&#x201d; He pointed our way into a boardinghouse. It was a modest wooden structure near the slow, dark river that separated New York from New Jersey. Well-dressed and well-bred gentlemen boarders occupied the sitting room. Pushing the<br> cart into Mr. Fergins&#x2019;s chambers on the ground floor, the umbrella tumbled from the top shelf.<br> &nbsp;<br> As I retrieved it, I noticed it was misshapen, with the general form of a banana, and there was a stain on the striped fabric of the umbrella, a dark red, perhaps rust. The bookseller seemed embarrassed by its condition and tucked it back into the cart. &#x201c;Always rolling off . . .&#x201d; he...</p><h2>The Joy in Loving: A Guide to Daily Living with Mother Teresa</h2><p>Offers a collection of reflections and insights from Mother Teresa&#39;s experiences</p><p>The authors, who worked closely with Mother Teresa during her lifetime, have drawn together stories and prayers inspired by the missionary, who worked tirelessly on behalf of India&#39;s poor with her sisters of charity. Each day of the year is assigned a brief story or blessing: A child goes without sugar so Mother Teresa may have it; a truckload of bread miraculously arrives for starving Indians when the rice has run out. Many of the passages are quotes from Mother Teresa herself, and all of them challenge the reader to live up to her saintly view of humanity and suffering. If the day-by-day approach doesn&#39;t fit, there&#39;s an easy-to-browse index, organized by theme (&#34;cheerfulness,&#34; &#34;humility,&#34; &#34;suffering&#34;). Her standards are high, however, and normal sinners may find her words more challenging than uplifting.In 365 daily entries, Mother Teresa -- beloved crusader for the poor and symbol of charity and compassion -- ruminates on the importance of work and prayer, charity and service, the right to life and, above all, the need to love, unconditionally and absolutely. Drawing on a lifetime of selfless service to the poorest of the poor, she speaks of men and women in the midst of great poverty who have lived and died uncomplainingly; of wealthy businessmen whose indifference has been transformed into compassion and charity; and of her encounters with people and governments around the globe.<p>For all those who seek to find meaning and fulfillment in life, The Joy in Loving will prove a constant source of guidance, comfort, and peace.</p></p><h2>Star Scroll</h2><p>The sequel to &#34;Dragon Prince&#34;, this novel deals with Pol, the son of High Prince Rohan and his sunrunner wife Sioned.

"Absolute power corrupts absolutely." The roar of the waves nearly drowned out his words. The six of them were seated Indian style around a campfire on the beach. Thresh glanced around the circle: Blossom, Ash, Goob, Angel, and Reefer. Not their real names, of course. No one here went by real names.</p> <p>Blossom had her gaze on Ash, and Thresh shuffled on his rock. He knew one way to get her attention. She hated the president. "Nixon is the Antichrist," he said loudly. "Someone should take him out."</p> <p>"Who cares?" Ash lay back with his head propped on a lava rock. Thresh slumped when Blossom continued to stare at Ash and didn't even remark on his comment. The sweet scent of roasting marshmallows mingled with the salty breeze. The blue sky was a curtain above their heads. He tried to think of some other way to capture her attention.</p> <p>"I still haven't seen Elizabeth Taylor," Blossom said, clasping her arms around her legs as she sat on the sand. "Her cousin owns this place. You'd think she'd come visit sometime. She's so fab."</p> <p>Thresh smiled at her. "No one is more fab than you, Blossom."</p> <p>As fragile as an orchid, she could sit on her black hair. Dressed in a bikini with a ginger blossom in her hair, she looked a little like Annette Funicello. Thresh watched as she fingered the pearl peace symbol on her necklace.</p> <p>Taylor Camp had been their home for three months. They had inherited the tree house above his head from a couple of residents who got busted for growing weed. The tree house had real glass windows and doors. It looked right up the Na Pali Coast. The camp used to be on the beach, but the winter rains kept washing it out, so the residents took to the trees. About a hundred residents wandered in and out of camp on a regular basis. Thresh never wanted to leave here.</p> <p>Ash stood. "I'm bored. Let's go for a swim."</p> <p>Thresh glanced around. The others were all too stoned to move, but a swim sounded good. "I'll go. Want to come, Blossom?"</p> <p>She shook her head. "I'm going to take some clothes to the stream and wash them. Have fun."</p> <p>Her dark eyes seemed illuminated from within. He watched her sashay across the sand, stepping lightly from one black rock to another.</p> <p>"Shake it, don't break it," Ash called after her.</p> <p>She turned and blew Ash a kiss. Ash grabbed at the air as if he'd caught it, and Thresh wanted to puke. Was something going on between them? "You going to stand there staring all day?" Thresh snapped.</p> <p>Ash flipped Thresh the bird. "Climb it, Tarzan," he said. He stalked toward the ocean.</p> <p>If Thresh weren't so angry, he wouldn't brave the surf, but he plunged after Ash, anger giving him power against the waves. The blue-green water enveloped them, and they kicked out in long strokes to get past the breakers. In the next moment, a riptide grabbed hold, and the waves tugged Thresh down. His lungs burned, and he fought the panic that had him in an even tighter grip. The rocky bottom rushed past in a kaleidoscope of brightly colored coral, golden sand, and black lava rock.</p> <p>The next instant, the churning waves slammed his body onto the bottom. Rocks battered Thresh's chest, and streaks of red ran through the water. Which way was up? He was too dazed to even watch the bubbles rise as they hissed from his lips. He had to breathe! His lungs burned with a nearly unbearable desire to draw in oxygen, but it was impossible to break the undertow. Swimming parallel with the beach, Thresh quit fighting and let the riptide have its way. Ash tumbled past, his eyes wide, and a silent scream opened his mouth. The two collided in the churning current and grabbed instinctively at each other. The tide tumbled them around, then just as suddenly, it released them.</p> <p>Thresh bobbed to the top like a seal. He took a huge lungful of the best air in the world and stared up into the blue sky. He floated there a moment and tried to collect his thoughts, but he felt another tug, and before he could react, the current took hold again. He managed one gulp of air before the riptide took him under again. Fish rushed past, or rather, he rushed past them. He had a vague impression of parrot fish.</p> <p>His lungs began to burn again. The current propelled him toward a rocky finger that jutted into the water. If the water rammed him against the rocks, he'd die. Thresh dove deep, trying to break the current's grip. The riptide seemed to weaken, then it took a stronger grip and hurled him toward the rocks, then down along the bottom.</p> <p>He realized Ash was on the same course he was. They rushed through a narrow tunnel so dark they couldn't see anything, adding to the sense of impending doom. Then the grip of the undertoe relaxed. Feeling as though his lungs were about to explode, Thresh kicked up and up, past glowing plankton on the walls, past a colony of shrimp, until his starving lungs could take no more. He inhaled water just as his head broke into air. The shock of salt water in his lungs made him gag and sputter, but he managed to keep from vomiting.</p> <p>Ash bobbed up beside him and flailed in the still water. "Where are we?"</p> <p>"Some kind of cave." The ceiling hovered only about five feet overhead. The water was as clear as a goldfish bowl, and plankton lit the area enough for Thresh to make out Ash's face. Thresh glanced around. "Hey, look at the coral. I've never seen anything like it."</p> <p>"Far out!" Ash dove to the bottom and grabbed a piece of the lapis lazuli-colored coral.</p> <p>Thresh knew enough about coral to realize they were looking at some of the rarest and most valuable coral on the planet. Aware his mouth was gaping, he closed it. Ash bobbed to the surface with a piece held up in his hand like a trophy. "Blossom will dig this."</p> <p>Thresh's heart clenched at the mention of her name. "I thought you were gone over Angel."</p> <p>Ash shook his head. "I already plucked that flower, man. And she's knocked up. Can you dig it?"</p> <p>He was always on the make. Blossom would be his next victim. Unless Thresh stopped him. Blossom deserved better. "Hey, dude, do me a favor and lay off her," he said.</p> <p>Ash widened his eyes. "Jealous, Thresh?"</p> <p>Ash's smirk sent a white-hot wave of anger over him. Thresh launched toward him, his hands digging into Ash's throat. Gulping in a lungful of air, the hated face went under the water against the coral reef on the bottom. After the ride on the current, Ash struggled very little, and it was over quickly.</p> <p>Thresh stared at the body floating in the water. He backed away as Ash's body bobbed closer. Then the sea foamed, and dorsal fins emerged from the sea. He gasped and flailed back as three tiger sharks zoomed around the enclosure. They were easily twenty feet in length, and he saw a flash of teeth from the closest one. He expected to feel those sharp teeth at any minute as they circled, but the scent of fresh blood pulled them away. They homed in on Ash's body. It was tugged around in the water, then disappeared under the surface.</p> <p>In moments, the sea boiled blood red.</p> <p>Thresh knew the sharks would not be satisfied with Ash's body for long. They would destroy him next. He slammed his eyes shut and waited to feel the first shark's teeth tear into his leg. His heart thundered in his ears, and he prayed to Kanaloa, the god of the sea.</p> <p>Time stretched out until he thought he would howl. Then the sound of churning bodies in the water faded, and he opened one cautious eye. Then the other.</p> <p>What was that he heard? Whispers of voices seemed to radiate from the walls, but the sharks were gone. It was a sign. Kanaloa, Hawaiian god of the ocean, must have intervened. Thresh answered the voices: "I hear, Kanaloa. I hear and serve."</p></p><h2>Bloody Genius (A Virgil Flowers Novel)</h2><p><b>Virgil Flowers will have to watch his back--and his mouth--as he investigates a college culture war turned deadly in another one of Sandford's "madly entertaining Virgil Flowers mysteries" (New York Times Book Review).</b><br><br>At the local state university, two feuding departments have faced off on the battleground of science and medicine.

Leave.<br><br>Trapped in a place? Leave.<br><br>Trapped in your car under a river? Crank the window open and swim to freedom.<br><br>It was a great and simple solution that I alone had come up with, and I didn&#x2019;t understand why nobody else had managed to grasp the concept. Among my friends, I was the Messiah of this movement. I said things like: &#x201c;If that apartment sucks, just move.&#x201d; And: &#x201c;If you need to fuck a lot of people, just leave him.&#x201d; And: &#x201c;Study abroad!&#x201d; My friends said things like: Oh and Wow and Hmm and It&#x2019;s Not That Simple, and You Make It Sound So Simple.<br><br>When I grew older, however, it wasn&#x2019;t so much that I learned that I was wrong (this is still a philosophy that, intellectually, I subscribe to), but rather that there were scenarios I hadn&#x2019;t thought of. For example: imagine an island. You are on this island. You are alone. There is nobody else with you. Leave! you might say. Okay. But you need a boat. There is no boat on your island, so you need to build a boat. Build a boat! you might say. Okay, but you don&#x2019;t know how, and there is no Wi-Fi on your island, so you can&#x2019;t look it up on YouTube&#x2014;but okay, you can guess how to build a boat. It involves chopping down trees and hewing them and fastening them and&#x2014;fuck it, you&#x2019;ll build a raft. But you need tools. You need sharp tools that will chop through wood. You have no tools. And you&#x2019;re so tired. This entire attempt has made you tired. So what are you going to do? Well, you don&#x2019;t know, and you haven&#x2019;t given up on the idea of leaving, but you&#x2019;re just going to sit very still for a time. You&#x2019;re just going to sit very still and not move at all, and try to filter the right answer out of the shadow that is descending from the canopy of uncuttable trees that loom over your head.<br><br>You see, there is a scenario in which you can&#x2019;t just Leave.<br><br>Now imagine that there are a hundred of these islands. And on each island is a little person, crouched down on the ground, trying to filter sense out of shadow, without a boat. Now you have a hundred people who can&#x2019;t just Leave.<br><br>And so it goes.<br><br>Sometime in June, I go see Camilo perform. We&#x2019;ve been dating for two years, and as Camilo&#x2019;s girlfriend, it&#x2019;s my duty to attend his first performance piece in all that time. He&#x2019;s so excited that I can&#x2019;t tell him my deep personal failing: namely, that I don&#x2019;t like performance art. I think either you&#x2019;re performing, or you&#x2019;re making art. I think that performance art is something that people do because they&#x2019;re not good enough actors to just perform, and they&#x2019;re not skilled enough artists to just make art.<br><br>But I don&#x2019;t say this.<br><br>On my way to the venue, a basement in deepest Brooklyn, I talk out loud to myself. I practice telling Camilo that I love his work, without sounding like I&#x2019;m lying. It&#x2019;s harder than you think, but I find that it relies more on tone of voice than words, and by the time I get there, I sound convincing.<br><br>Camilo&#x2019;s friends Ev and Keira meet me on the sidewalk outside. Ev has been a lesbian, but Ev is about to transition into being a man. Ev&#x2019;s current gender pronoun of choice is E. Ev says that certain things are inherent, that E identifies as gay before E is a gender, and therefore when E fully becomes a man, E will have no choice but to date men. I understand the idea of inherence. As in: this person is inherently skilled. This person is inherently clumsy. I am concerned because Camilo is inherently clumsy with things like words and money and other people&#x2019;s feelings. He loses his socks and he interrupts you. If you are inherently clumsy, chances are slim that you will make finely tuned work.<br><br>We crowd into the basement. Keira keeps her sunglasses on. Keira is only here for Camilo, she wants that to be clear. Keira is the friend you talk to when things go wrong in your life, because things are constantly wrong in hers. She is very good at telling you it is not your fault, when quite possibly it is your fault. This is a good friend for you to have, but not a good friend for your girlfriend, because you will only ever mention her to Keira when you are angry and sad.<br><br>Sometimes I make Camilo sad, and this is the first thing Keira knows about me. She knows that I once said that I didn&#x2019;t understand how Camilo&#x2019;s friends could protest the death penalty and then walk by homeless people on the street&#x2014;if you believe all human life has value (which I do not), then shouldn&#x2019;t you act accordingly at all times? Camilo wouldn&#x2019;t speak to me for a day after that, nor would he articulate which part of my statement upset him the most.<br><br>What Keira does not know about: The time Camilo and I skipped work, took the Metro-North outside the city to Dia: Beacon, and ate picnic sandwiches in the grass. The time we read the entirety of Roald Dahl&#x2019;s The Twits out loud on the subway, during a trip from the top of Manhattan to the tail of Brooklyn. The time Camilo had a brief but intense nervous breakdown, after a prolonged phone call with his mother, and I stayed up the whole night talking him through it.<br><br>These are not the things you would ever tell a friend like Keira, even if they are also part of the map of your relationship. Keira has one map, and the friend to whom you tell all your good things has the other map, and you just have a jumble of chicken-scrawl on a napkin. And that is why your friends always think they know where you should be going, and yet you yourself are so often lost.<br><br>For the past two years, I have been dating Camilo, and not leaving. I moved to the large brownstone co-op in which he lives, where things like books and plants and people go missing, slide between the cracks of the ancient and splintering floorboards. There are whole countries that have gone missing inside this house. There are people who emerge from doorways and their faces are unrecognizable faces, because they are faces that have gone missing as well. In this way, Camilo and his house together are not unlike the island of Doctor Moreau.<br><br>Now we&#x2019;re in the basement. We are invited to line the walls, standing or kneeling, creating an open rectangle in the center. There is a microphone, waiting at the end of the open rectangle. The concrete floor is cool under my knees, and it feels good after the humidity outside. As the last people trail inside and settle into a hush, Camilo walks out. We are silent, eyes trained on him. He is wearing a white T-shirt. The armpits are stained. The elastic of his black sweatpants is too old, they&#x2019;re sagging dangerously at the waist, and his long hair is loose. I can&#x2019;t tell if he looks like an Artist or a serial killer. I hope everybody in the room is thinking he looks like an Artist. I hope they&#x2019;re thinking about how authentic he seems, how unfettered by societal norms. I briefly hate myself for even letting the thought serial killer slip across my mind. Ev, Keira, and I arrange our faces to look encouraging. Keira makes a little &#x201c;yeah&#x201d; noise, a little &#x201c;go get &#x2019;em tiger&#x201d; noise, but Ev is completely focused. Ev also identifies as a performance artist, and is Taking This Seriously. Regardless of why we&#x2019;re here, we all want him to succeed. We desperately want this to be good. The better it is, the less lying we will have to do.<br><br>Camilo starts to windmill his arms. I think he&#x2019;s stretching, he&#x2019;s working up to something, he&#x2019;s preparing for takeoff. He keeps windmilling. Any minute now, he&#x2019;s going to stop, shake himself off, and begin something that requires very loose shoulders. He keeps windmilling. Now two minutes have passed and Camilo is still very vigorously windmilling his arms. I sneak a sideways look at Keira. Her sunglasses are still on and you can&#x2019;t see her eyes and suddenly I&#x2019;m jealous that I didn&#x2019;t think of wearing sunglasses. Now it&#x2019;s three minutes. I am starting to be concerned for Camilo&#x2019;s rotator cuffs. My best friend is in med school, and she has told me about rotator cuff injuries and how often they require surgery. She has told me that you may think cartilage is tough, but actually in certain situations it tears like paper, and then you&#x2019;re fucked. Camilo&#x2019;s cartilage might be tearing this very second, and for what? Now it&#x2019;s four minutes. Keira&#x2019;s sunglasses reflect a small and determined Camilo, glistening with sweat, churning his arms in circles.<br><br>Ev gets up. For one shocked moment, I think E is going to leave. E has decided that This Is Not Art, and is going to leave! Is this a gesture of great friendship, because of the depth of its honesty? Should I, as his girlfriend, be so honest as well? The idea is wild and liberating. Then Ev walks to the microphone stand, and I realize that Ev and Camilo must have agreed to this ahead of time. There is a piece of paper taped to the stand. E lifts it up. E begins to read.<br><br>As Camilo windmills his way up and down the room, Ev reads a series of sentences about Camilo&#x2019;s mother. These are recollections from when Camilo was a child. His mother is cool and brutal and absent. The sentences all seem to begin &#x201c;I am six (or eight or four or ten), and my mother . . .&#x201d; and then they finish badly. She frightens him. She chastises him. She abandons him, for days or weeks at a time. Ev&#x2019;s voice seems to incite Camilo to a more vigorous windmilling. Ev stops mid-sentence, replaces the paper, and walks offstage. A moment. We are hushed. Is it over?<br><br>But no. Keira jumps to her feet. Now she understands what is being asked of her, of all of us, as audience members and participants. She darts into the open space and picks up the piece of paper, with great purpose. She reads from the paper in a big voice. Camilo&#x2019;s mother once locked him in a closet. Camilo&#x2019;s mother threw away his diary. Camilo&#x2019;s mother hangs up the phone before he is finished talking.<br><br>Some are stories that I knew already, but I thought they were private quiet stories told late at night, and now they are stories being told in big voices in a big basement with mid-afternoon light soaking through the street-level windows. This changes the stories. I don&#x2019;t want it to change the stories, but it changes the stories.<br><br>Keira stops mid-sentence, the way Ev did, and returns to the wall. We wait through a long painful silence. The look on Camilo&#x2019;s face is a frown bordering on ecstasy. He&#x2019;s a little biplane, propelling itself forward and backward. His shirt has ridden up now, his sweatpants have slid down. The crisp curl of his stomach hair is visible, and the partial curve of an ass-cheek. Art is messy, I think defensively, in case anyone in the crowd is thinking that he looks insane. Art is not put-together.<br><br>A man that I don&#x2019;t know goes up to the microphone stand. He takes the paper hesitantly. He is older than we are. I don&#x2019;t know if he wandered in here by accident. I like to imagine that maybe he did. Maybe he is a Brooklyn Dad, and he was Wandering By, and he noticed the crowd through one of the street-level windows, and he wanted to see What the Kids Were Doing. He has a decent face. He reads some sentences, but now they have looped back on themselves, they are repeating. Camilo makes the same gestures and the man reads out loud the same stories that Camilo told me late at night, that are the same sentences that Ev and Keira just read out into this dog-damp basement, that are the same sentences anyone will read for however much longer this performance lasts&#x2014;and I have a moment of pure and unflinching comprehension:<br><br>This is Hell.<br><br>I never thought there was such a thing as Hell, but this is it.<br><br>Here I am, Trapped in Hell.<br><br>I have been a bad human.<br><br>I have been a bad girlfriend.<br><br>I have lied and said I didn&#x2019;t get texts that I actually got but didn&#x2019;t want to reply to.<br><br>I have lied and said I had plans, when I just wanted to be alone.<br><br>I have lied and said &#x201c;Yes that was good&#x201d; after we had sex and it was bad and he asked if it was good.<br><br>I have lied and said that it&#x2019;s okay that he&#x2019;s stopped using shampoo because he doesn&#x2019;t believe in shampoo anymore, but actually I don&#x2019;t think it&#x2019;s okay, I think people should wash their hair.<br><br>I am a judgmental person, a cynic, a capitalist, someone who does not share with Camilo and his friends their fervent, delirious belief in the life-changing potential of political protest and art.<br><br>I am a sad lonely person with conservative values and a crippled soul who cannot appreciate performance art.<br><br>And this is my punishment. Here, in Hell.<br><br>And, what&#x2019;s more, I know what Dante once knew: Hell consists of many rings. The outer rings are things like the Subway, Times Square, Brokers&#x2019; Fees. The inner ones are things like Taxes, Grant Applications, Performance Art. Once you get past those, there is only one ring left, the innermost ring of Hell. And that ring is not this basement. That ring is what happens after this basement. That ring is the space of deceit and guilt that will be created the moment Camilo stops waving his arms. That ring is the thing that lies just ahead.<br><br>Afterward, we go to a bar down the street. Camilo&#x2019;s friends are abuzz with excitement, in part because we&#x2019;re finally out of the basement, mostly because we&#x2019;re day-drinking. Camilo lets them talk to him about poignancy and the truths of the body, and then he turns to me. His eyes are wide, guileless, depthless. This is the moment he has been waiting for. Every cell of his body strains toward me. &#x201c;What did you think?&#x201d; he asks, desperately casual.<br><br>I smile at him. I force every cell of my body into an upward position. I try to radiate. I am thermonuclear.<br><br>&#x201c;It was so interesting,&#x201d; I say. &#x201c;It was really really interesting.&#x201d;<br><br>I meant to say good. I meant to say good. Why couldn&#x2019;t I say good! I&#x2019;d silently practiced the word good.</p><h2>Adelante Uno: An Invitation to Spanish, 2nd Edition,</h2><p>Normal wear and tear from moderate use.

Howatch was born in Surrey, England. She began writing as a teen and published her first book when she moved to the United States in 1964. Howatch found global success first with her five sagas and then with her novels about the Church of England in the twentieth century. She has now returned to live in Surrey.</p>The sixth and final volume in a series that began with Glittering Images, this novel again displays Howatch's ability to meld an involving, character-driven story with a larger theme, that of spiritual quest and fulfillment. This time, however, the centrality-and discussion-of ecclesiastical issues tends to slow the narrative. The book is set during the mid-1960s, the period during which the Church of England-not to mention the rest of the country and beyond-was rocked by widespread challenges to tradition. Again representing tradition is narrator Charles Ashworth, the Anglican Bishop of Starbridge, who promotes the so-called Middle Way, a half-and-half mixture of Catholicism and Protestantism. Ashworth's archenemy-and doppelganger-is Neville Aysgarth, the Dean of the Cathedral who is, according to Ashworth, unorthodoxly open to using the trappings of a capitalistic marketplace to benefit the financially deteriorating church building. To make matters worse, Aysgarth is an alleged dipsomaniac and womanizer, who once made a pass at Ashworth's beloved wife, Lyle. When Lyle dies suddenly, the bereaved widower strays dangerously from the fold, but he does not experience a redemption-through-repentance journey as dramatic as those of Arthur Dimmesdale or Raskolnikov. Which isn't to say that Ashworth doesn't suffer, but his enlightenment is far less dramatic and therefore less convincing than those literary prototypes, and it's unsettling that at the end he still thinks skeletons in the cupboard can be exorcised through intellectual speculation. Lucidly written for those who have not read the other volumes, Absolute Truths should prove to be a satisfying finishing stroke for those who have.

Likewise, Neil Broom asks, was the universe created by the blind forces of physics and chemistry, or is there evidence in nature of a designing mind?While prominent scientists in recent years have suggested that the watchmaker is indeed blind, Broom, a biomechanics scientist, sees much more than their naturalistic blinders allow them to perceive. His book How Blind Is the Watchmaker? boldly challenges the scientific establishment&#39;s commitment to what he labels as &#34;the flimsily crafted but persuasively packaged myth of scientific materialism.&#34;Broom reveals how naturalistic science is guilty of attempting to reduce all explanations to the molecular level, even when higher nonmaterial levels of explanation are clearly required to describe the behavior of many systems. Likewise he shows why there is little chance that science can define life in a way that seamlessly connects it to the inanimate world. Broom also uncovers the rarely discussed or acknowledged assumptions that raise serious questions about the limits of a purely naturalistic approach to the problem of life&#39;s genesis. In a clear and readable style, he considers the recent research about the origin of life and the function of RNA, DNA and proteins. Further, he exposes how scientists often attribute &#34;personal&#34; characteristics to inanimate molecules. And he shows why postulating billions of years for various natural processes does not adequately explain inadequacies in evolutionary scenarios.This thought-provoking book (a thoroughly revised and updated edition of the volume originally published by Ashgate) points beyond the poverty of many scientific pronouncements and builds a robust case for viewing the true splendor of our living world.</p><p>Broom, a biomaterials engineer writing from a Christian perspective, makes a spirited but ungainly case against Darwinism as he defends a return of purpose and intentionality to biological explanation. The book's most helpful material is found in chapters four through seven where Broom reviews life-origins research, comparing the failure or limited success of most studies with widespread and extravagant claims in the "pop science" realm that the basic problem of biogenesis has been solved. The second half of Broom's treatise takes a turn for the worse as the subject matter shifts from specific research results to evolutionary theory and the philosophy of biology, a conceptual thicket where careful distinctions and judicious arguments become crucially important. In this section, Broom's lack of sympathy for his opponents often colors his presentation of their arguments; in some cases it is unclear whether he has really understood them. An uncharitable reading of Darwinism lures him into a tendentious and muddled argument about natural selection in which he seems to be forcing Darwinists to interpret the metaphor of "selection" in terms of literal intentionan interpretation any orthodox or neo-Darwinist is bound to disavow. Readers looking for an accessible critique of Darwinism and scientific materialism will fare better with Phillip Johnson's The Wedge of Truth (also from IVP), which offers clearer arguments and more sure-footed reasoning as it covers much of the same ground. <p></p><p>Copyright 2001 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p></p><h2>Bones of the Hills (Conqueror, Book 3)</h2><p>Bones of the Hills: The Epic Story of the great Conqueror (Conqueror 3)</p><p>Born in London, Conn Iggulden read English at London University and worked as a teacher for seven years before becoming a full-time writer. Married with three children, he lives in Hertfordshire.<i>Chapter One<br><br></i><br> THE WIND HAD FALLEN on the high ridge. Dark clouds drifted above, making bands of shadow march across the earth. The morning was quiet and the land seemed empty as the two men rode at the head of a narrow column, a jagun of a hundred young warriors. The Mongols could have been alone for a thousand miles, with just creaking leather and snorting ponies to break the stillness. When they halted to listen, it was as if silence rolled back in over the dusty ground.<br><br>Tsubodai was a general to the Great Khan, and it showed in the way he held himself. His armor of iron scales over leather was well worn, with holes and rust in many places. His helmet was marked where it had saved his life more than once. All his equipment was battered, but the man himself remained as hard and unforgiving as the winter earth. In three years of raiding the north, he had lost only one minor skirmish and returned the following day to destroy the tribe before word could spread. He had mastered his trade in a land that seemed to grow colder with each mile into the wastes. He had no maps for his journey, just rumors of distant cities built on rivers frozen so solid that oxen could be roasted on the ice. <br><br>At his right shoulder rode Jochi, the eldest son of the khan himself. Barely seventeen, he was yet a warrior who might inherit the nation and perhaps command even Tsubodai in war. Jochi wore a similar set of greased leather and iron, as well as the saddle packs and weapons all the warriors carried. Tsubodai knew without asking that Jochi would have his ration of dried blood and milk, needing only water to make a nourishing broth. The land did not forgive those who took survival lightly, and both men had learned the lessons of winter.<br><br>Jochi sensed the scrutiny and his dark eyes flickered up, always guarded. He had spent more time with the young general than he ever had with his father, but old habits were hard to break. It was difficult for him to trust, though his respect for Tsubodai knew no limit. The general of the Young Wolves had a feel for war, though he denied it. Tsubodai believed in scouts, training, tactics, and archery above all else, but the men who followed him saw only that he won, no matter what the odds. As others could fashion a sword or a saddle, Tsubodai fashioned armies, and Jochi knew he was privileged to learn at his side. He wondered if his brother Chagatai had fared as well in the east. It was easy to daydream as he rode the hills, imagining his brothers and father struck dumb at the sight of how Jochi had grown and become strong. <br><br>"What is the most important item in your packs?" Tsubodai said suddenly.<br><br>Jochi raised his eyes to the brooding sky for an instant. Tsubodai delighted in testing him.<br><br>"Meat, General. Without meat, I cannot fight."<br><br>"Not your bow?" Tsubodai said. "Without a bow, what are you?"<br><br>"Nothing, General, but without meat, I am too weak to use the bow."<br><br>Tsubodai grunted at hearing his own words repeated. "When the meat is all gone, how long can you live off blood and milk?"<br><br>"Sixteen days at most, with three remounts to share the wounds."&nbsp; Jochi did not have to think. He had been drilled in the answers ever since he and Tsubodai had ridden with ten thousand men from the shadow of the Chin emperor's city.<br><br>"How far could you travel in such a time?" Tsubodai said.<br><br>Jochi shrugged.&nbsp; "Sixteen hundred miles with fresh remounts. Half again as far if I slept and ate in the saddle." <br><br>Tsubodai saw that the young man was hardly concentrating, and his eyes glinted as he changed tack. <br><br>"What is wrong with the ridge ahead?" he snapped.<br><br>Jochi raised his head, startled. "I . . ."<br><br>"Quickly! Men are looking to you for a decision. Lives wait on your word."<br><br>Jochi swallowed, but in Tsubodai he had learned from a master.<br><br>"The sun is behind us, so we will be visible for miles as we reach the crest." Tsubodai began to nod, but Jochi went on. "The ground is dusty. If we cross the high point of the ridge at any speed, we will raise a cloud into the air."<br><br>"That is good, Jochi," Tsubodai said. As he spoke, he dug in his heels and rode hard at the crest ahead. As Jochi had predicted, the hundred riders released a mist of reddish grit that billowed above their heads. Someone would surely see and report their position.<br><br>Tsubodai did not pause as he reached the ridge. Digging in his heels, he sent his mare over, the rear legs skittering on loose stones. Jochi matched him and then took a sharp breath of dust that made him cough into his hand. Tsubodai had come to a halt fifty paces beyond the ridge, where the broken ground began to dip to the valley. Without orders, his men formed a wide double rank around him, like a bow drawn on the ground. They were long familiar with the firebrand of a general who had been placed over them. <br><br>Tsubodai stared into the distance, frowning. The surrounding hills enclosed a flat plain through which a river ran, swollen with spring rain. Along its banks, a slow-moving column trotted, bright with flags and banners. In other circumstances, it would have been a sight to take the breath, and even as his stomach clenched, Jochi felt a touch of admiration. Ten, perhaps eleven thousand Russian knights rode together, house colors in gold and red streaming back over their heads. Almost as many followed them in a baggage train of carts and remounts, women, boys, and servants. The sun chose that moment to break through the dark clouds in a great beam that lit the valley. The knights shone.<br><br>Their horses were massive, shaggy animals, almost twice the weight of the Mongol ponies. Even the men who rode them were a strange breed to Jochi's eyes. They sat like they were made of stone, solid and heavy in metal cloth from their cheeks to their knees. Only their blue eyes and hands were unprotected. The armored knights had come prepared for battle, carrying long spears like lances, but tipped in steel. They rode with the weapons upright, the butts held in leather cups close behind the stirrups. Jochi could see axes and swords hanging down from waist belts, and every man rode with a leaf-shaped shield hooked to his saddle. The pennants streamed back over their heads and they looked very fine in the bands of gold and shadow. <br><br>"They must see us," Jochi murmured, glancing at the plume of dust above his head.<br><br>The general heard him speak and turned in the saddle. "They are not men of the plains, Jochi. They are half blind over such a distance. Are you afraid? They are so large, these knights. I would be afraid."<br><br>For an instant, Jochi glowered. From his father, it would have been mockery. Yet Tsubodai spoke with a light in his eyes. The general was still in his twenties, young to command so many. Tsubodai was not afraid, though. Jochi knew the general cared nothing for the massive warhorses or the men who rode them. Instead, he placed his faith in the speed and arrows of his Young Wolves.<br><br>The jagun was made up of ten arbans, each commanded by an officer. By Tsubodai's order, only those ten men wore heavy armor. The rest had only leather tunics under padded deels. Jochi knew Genghis preferred the heavy charge to the light, but Tsubodai's men seemed to survive. They could hit and gallop faster than the ponderous Russian warriors, and there was no fear in their ranks. Like Tsubodai, they looked hungrily down the slope at the column and waited to be seen.<br><br>"You know your father sent a rider to bring me home?" Tsubodai said.<br><br>Jochi nodded. "All the men know."<br><br>"I had hoped to go further north than this, but I am your father's man. He speaks and I obey, do you understand?"<br><br>Jochi stared at the young general, forgetting for a moment the knights who rode in the valley below.<br><br>"Of course," he said, his face showing nothing.<br><br>Tsubodai glanced back at him, amused. "I hope you do, Jochi. He is a man to follow, your father. I wonder how he will respond when he sees how well you have grown."<br><br>For a moment, anger twisted Jochi's face before he smoothed his features and took a deep breath. Tsubodai had been more like a father than his own in many ways, but he did not forget the man's true loyalty. At an order from Genghis, Tsubodai would kill him. As he looked at the young general, he thought there would be some regret, but not enough to hold the blow.<br><br>"He will need loyal men, Tsubodai," Jochi said. "My father would not call us back to build or rest. He will have found some new land to tear to pieces. Like the wolf, he is always hungry, even to the point of bursting his own stomach."<br><br>Tsubodai frowned to hear the khan described in such a way. In three years, he had seen no affection when Jochi spoke of his father, though sometimes there was a wistfulness that showed less and less as the seasons passed. Genghis had sent away a boy, but a man would return to him, Tsubodai had made certain of that. For all his bitterness, Jochi was a cool head in battle and the men looked on him with pride. He would do.<br><br>"I have another question for you, Jochi," Tsubodai said.<br><br>Jochi smiled for an instant. "You always have, General," he replied. <br><br>"We have drawn these iron knights after us for hundreds of miles, exhausting their horses. We have captured their scouts and put them to the question, though I do not know of this 'Jerusalem' they seek, or who this 'white Christ' is." Tsubodai shrugged. "Perhaps I will meet him one day over the length of my sword, but the world is large and I am but one man." <br><br>As he spoke, he watched the armored knights and the trailing baggage lines behind them, waiting to be seen.<br><br>"My question, Jochi, is this. These knights are nothing to me. Your father has called me back and I could ride now, while the ponies are fat with summer grass. Why then are we here, waiting for the challenge?"<br><br>Jochi's eyes were cold as he replied.<br><br>"My father would say it is what we do, that there is no better way for a man to spend his years than at war with enemies. He might also say you enjoy it, General, and that is all the reason you need."<br><br>Tsubodai's gaze did not waver. <br><br>"Perhaps he would say that, but you hide behind his words. Why are we here, Jochi? We do not want their big horses, even for meat. Why will I risk the lives of warriors to smash the column you see?"<br><br>Jochi shrugged irritably. "If it is not that, I do not know."<br><br>"For you, Jochi," Tsubodai said seriously. "When you return to your father, you will have seen all forms of battle, in all seasons. You and I have captured towns and raided cities, ridden desert and forests so thick we could hardly cut our way through. Genghis will find no weakness in you." Tsubodai smiled briefly at Jochi's stony expression. "I will be proud when men say you learned your skill under Tsubodai the Valiant."<br><br>Jochi had to grin at hearing the nickname from Tsubodai himself. There were no secrets in the camps.<br><br>"There it is," Tsubodai muttered, pointing to a distant messenger racing to the head of the Russian column. "We have an enemy who leads from the front, a very brave man."<br><br>Jochi could imagine the sudden dismay among the knights as they looked into the bowl of hills and saw the Mongol warriors. <br><br>Tsubodai grunted softly as an entire rank peeled off the column and began trotting up the slopes, the long spears ready. He showed his teeth as the gap began to narrow. They were charging uphill, in their arrogance. He longed to teach them their error.<br><br>"Do you have your paitze, Jochi? Show it to me."<br><br>Jochi reached behind him to where his bow holder was strapped to the saddle. He lifted a flap in the stiff leather and pulled out a plaque of solid gold, stamped with a wolf's head in profile. At twenty ounces, it was heavy, but small enough for him to grip in his hand.<br><br>Tsubodai ignored the men rising doggedly up the hill to face the eldest son of Genghis.<br><br>"You have that and the right to command a thousand by my hand, Jochi. Those who command a jagun have one of mere silver, like this." Tsubodai held up a larger block of the whitish metal. "The difference is that the silver paitze is given to a man elected by the officers of each arban below him."<br><br>"I know this," Jochi said.<br><br>Tsubodai glanced back at the knights laboring closer. "The officers of this jagun have asked to have you lead them, Jochi. I had no part in it." He held out the silver paitze and Jochi took it joyfully, passing back the plaque of gold.<br><br>Tsubodai was solemn and deliberately formal, but his eyes were bright. "When you return to your father, Jochi, you will have known all ranks and positions." The general gestured, cutting the air with his hand. "On the right, the left, and the center." He looked over the heads of the straining knights cantering up the hill, seeing a flicker of movement on a crag in the distance. Tsubodai nodded sharply.<br><br>"It is time. You know what you have to do, Jochi. Command is yours." Without another word, Tsubodai clapped the younger man on the shoulder and rode back over the ridge, leaving the jagun of riders in the care of one suddenly nervous leader.<br><br>Jochi could feel the combined stares of the hundred men on his back as he struggled to hide his pleasure. Each arban of ten elected one man to lead them, then those men elected one of their number to lead the hundred in war. To be so chosen was an honor. A voice in his mind whispered that they only honored his father, but he crushed it, refusing to doubt. He had earned the right and confidence swelled in him.<br><br>"Bow lines!" Jochi called. He gripped his reins tightly to hide his tension as the men formed a wider line so that every bow could bear. Jochi glanced over his shoulder, but Tsubodai had truly gone, leaving him alone. The men still watched and he forced the cold face, knowing they would remember his calm. As they raised their bows, he held up a clenched fist, waiting while his heart thumped painfully in his chest.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>At four hundred paces, Jochi dropped his arm and the first flight of arrows whipped into the air. It was too far and those that reached the knights splintered on their shields, now held high and forward, so that almost the entire man was protected. The long shields showed their purpose as a second flight struck the ranks without a single rider going down.<br><br>The powerful horses were not fast, but still the gap closed and Jochi only watched. At two hundred paces, he raised his fist once more and another hundred arrows waited on creaking strings. At such a distance, he did not know if the knights' armor would save them. Nothing ever had. <br><br>"Shoot like you have never owned a bow," he shouted. The men around him grinned and the arrows snapped out. Jochi winced instinctively at shafts that went clear over the enemy heads, as if loosed by panicking fools. Only a few struck, and of those, still fewer brought a horse or man down. They could hear the thunder of the charge now and saw the front ranks begin to lower their spears in anticipation.<br><br>Facing them, Jochi smothered his fear in a sudden bloom of rage. He wanted nothing more than to draw his sword and kick his mount down the slope at the enemy. Shaking with frustration, he gave a different order.<br><br>"Retreat over the ridge," Jochi shouted. He wrenched at his reins and his horse jerked into a run. His jagun shouted incoherently, turning in chaos after their general. Behind him, he heard guttural voices yelling in triumph and acid rose in his throat, though whether it was from fear or anger, he did not know.<br><i>From the Hardcover edition.</i></p><h2>Amish Roots: A Treasury of History, Wisdom, and Lore (Center Books in Anabaptist Studies)</h2><p><p>It isn't the way of the Amish to write about themselves.

(He lost it all to King George's alert customs men.) In 1863 Amish bishop Daniel Beachy faces down a company of Confederate cavalry who try to steal his horse on a muddy Maryland highway.

She and her husband live in Greenwich, CT.Skillfully constructed rhymes and tender, tidily detailed watercolors point out to children all the "cozy doings" of "a very cozy day," from the time "you wake up bright and early/ In your roasty toasty bed" all the way to bedtime. Hoberman names cozy things to eat, cozy smells and sounds ("The gurgle that a gargle makes/ The giggle when a tickle takes"), cozy words ("Pachysandra/ Sarsaparilla/ Tusk and smug and fog/ Galoshes"), etc. Fraser, who teamed with Hoberman for A House Is a House for Me, illustrates specific entries on Hoberman's list and also sets whole scenes that embrace a number of "cozy" activities. Her world is a bright one-characters are inevitably rosy-cheeked, their clothes festively patterned, their houses and schoolrooms and playgrounds definitely lived-in.

Rose</b></p> <p>NYT Bestseller <strong>Katherine Neville</strong> interviews M.J. Rose about <i>The Book of Lost Frangrances</i>.</p> <p><strong>Katherine Neville: </strong>I have to confess that part of why I was so drawn to <i>The Book of Lost Frangrances</i> is that you and I share a fascination with telling stories that interweave multiple themes--romance, history, science, esoteric, mystery, etc. What do you feel is the challenge and great payoff of stepping off the edge like that?</p> <p><strong>M.J. Rose:</strong> I think it's the ultimate challenge of any book, really--to make every one of those themes and elements you describe strike notes that feel true and surprising and human. But I guess the added challenge--and also the reward, if you've done it right--of 'stepping off the edge' with all those pieces in play is the hope that the notes work together to form a rich and resonant and emotionally satisfying chord by the time the book's done. Even though this is a suspense novel, a lot of my friends have told me that the ending of <i>The Book of Lost Frangrances</i> made them cry--to me that's the ultimate compliment!</p> <p><strong>Katherine Neville: </strong>It's often said that our sense of smell is our earliest memory. The earliest smell I could recall was ice on the branch of a tree, which may explain why I've always been captivated by stories like Hans Christian Anderson's Snow Queen and the snow scenes and music in Tchaikovsky's Nutcracker Suite.</p> <p>Tell me about your own earliest recollections of scent, and how perhaps they motivated you to write <i>The Book of Lost Fragrances</i>?</p> <p><strong>M.J. Rose:</strong> My mother wore only one perfume her whole life, Shalimar. And that fragrance, and the way it embodied my mother, figures in so many of my earliest memories. I was a very shy child, and when I first started school I always had a hard time when she got ready to leave. We had a routine. I'd cry. She'd take a handkerchief out of her pocketbook and give it to me to dry my tears. And then she'd go. But I'd still have that fragrant handkerchief. And I could still smell her. I suppose it felt that, as long as I had something that smelled of her, she was never too far away, and would always come back.</p> <p>Despite the fact that my books are labeled suspense, at heart I think I'm a very emotional writer. I think there's magic in how something as simple as my mother's perfume on a white linen cloth could give me so much comfort. I believe you find a character's heart when you discover what sight or sound or smell or taste moves them, or frightens them or makes them feel safe in the dark.</p> <p><strong>Katherine Neville: </strong>You and I both write what might be called Quest novels: the quest being the earliest tradition of literature. But in our books, instead of Parsifal questing after the Holy Grail or Jason seeking the Golden Fleece, or even Indiana Jones looking for the Lost Ark - we have female protagonists who are hunting for a mysterious object of universal power.</p> <p>What do you feel are the drawbacks, the difficulties, or ultimately the advantages, of having a female protagonist in what was traditionally, until very recently, a "male genre?"</p> <p><strong>M.J. Rose:</strong> I'm not sure it ever occurred to me that I was challenging the status quo, to be honest! For instance, in this book, it seemed totally natural that Jac L'Etoile would take up the search for a 2000 year old fragrance and have as great a chance of finding her holy grail as her brother or any man would.</p> <p>From first to twelfth grade I went to an all girl's school. When there are no boys around it's very liberating. It's never about "only boys should do this" or "only girls should do this." Instead it's just, what are you interested in, what do you care about? So when I started writing I never questioned the role I was assigning to my female protagonist--I wish I could say I was taking a stand, but really it just felt very natural to me.</p> <p><strong>Katherine Neville: </strong> On a more personal level, PERFUME: I cannot wear it because it "pops" on me about 3:00 in the afternoon. However, I collect it because I love the aromas, and I have my favorites that I love to smell, for various reasons. I have a collection, each reminds me of different phases of my life...</p> <p>What are your favorites? Do you wear them or keep them to relish privately? How does your relationship with these scents connect with Jac, the protagonist in the new book, and the way her 'destiny' plays itself out in the course of the story?</p> <p><strong>M.J. Rose:</strong> Many of my favorites are vintage scents that are no longer available but of those that are, I'm partial to Vol de Nuit by Guerlain, Citrine by Olivier Durbano, Coromandel by Chanel, Musc Ravageur by Frederic Malle... But the one that's become the most special for me is �mes Soeurs, which translates as 'the Scent of Soulmates.' It was created by the amazing Frederick Bouchardy of Joya Studios and was actually inspired by this novel!</p> <p>Jac wouldn't exist if not for my love of scent, and (to go back to that idea of "quest" you mentioned earlier) a search I started about ten years ago to find my own "signature scent." This led me deep into the fascinating world of fragrances, how they're created, and I became obsessed with the idea of a woman so attuned to scent that she could be haunted by it.</p>So many people have asked how I came up with the idea for this novel. <br><br>I was reading about Cleopatra (69 BCE to 30BCE), who was the last pharaoh of Ancient Egypt, and discovered she was fascinated with and some say obsessed by scent. So much so, Marc Anthony built her a fragrance factory where he planted now extinct flora and fauna including groves of balsam trees (important in the creation of perfume at the time) confiscated from Herod.<br><br>In the 1980s a team of Italian and Israeli archaeologists believe they unearthed the factory at the south end of theDead Sea, 30 km from Ein Gedi. Residues of ancient perfumes along with seats where customers received beauty treatments were found there.<br><br>Cleopatra was said to have kept a recipe book for her perfumes, entitled Cleopatra gynaeciarum libri. The book has been described in writings by historians Dioscorides, Homer and Pliny the Elder. <br><br>But no known copy of the book exists today.<br><br>When I read about that book, I knew I had the idea for a novel.</p><h2>The Last Algonquin</h2><p>A document of the life of an extraordinary man, the last of his tribe, who lived in an untouched corner of New York City, as his ancestors had lived before him</p><p><b>Theodore Kazimiroff</b>, the son of Joe Two Trees's young confidant, writes historical, environmental, and natural history articles for several magazines.

In its 1978 edition, with artwork by Diane Dawson, Polushkin's story about a misunderstanding arising from ambiguous punctuation had a relatively long run for its money; this newly illustrated version further extends its life. The premise is as silly as ever: Baby Mouse sends his fussbudget mom into a tizzy when he cries, "May I have another, mother?" Another <i>mother? </i>Startled but eager to satisfy her little darling, she auditions potential mom replacements (a duck, frog, pig, and donkey) until Baby Mouse finally explains that he merely wanted a second bedtime kiss<i>.</i> Less freely sketched than Dawson's original watercolors, Goodell's oils will charm readers with meticulously brushed village scenes populated by smartly attired animals. The cover image of Baby Mouse jumping on his bed in frustration may mislead some parents into expecting a lesson about managing behavior; others may question the portrayal of mothers as featherbrained and desperate to please. Young ones, though, will simply delight in the easy-to-grasp joke and the clueless elders' reliance on a knowing, powerful child. <i>Jennifer Mattson</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

Rachael Hale&#39;s signature style catches the eye of everyone who comes across it. Featuring 101 color photographs of Chihuahuas, Great Danes, and everything in between, 101 SALIVATIONS presents dogs in all sorts of wonderful poses that bring out their most endearing characteristics. Rachael&#39;s secret to capturing a dog&#39;s soul is to focus on his eyes-whether they are wide and shining, or heavy-lidded, in the throes of slumber. Within this book we can see the soul of our own best buddies staring back at us. The book is peppered with humorous and touching quotations from well-known authors such as A.A. Milne and Fran Lebowitz. Following in the paw prints of 101 SALIVATIONS, Rachael Hale&#39;s 101 CATACLYSMS is a charming and playful tribute to the world&#39;s most popular pet. This collection features 101 images of magnificent felines. Hale&#39;s special rapport with animals has allowed her to capture the essence of her subjects. You will see it in the bald-faced cheekiness of Hilander, the sphinx; in the sassiness of Puffy, the Persian ball of fluff; and in the playfulness of Yabba Dabba Doo, the British shorthair. 101 CATACLYSMS also contains quotations from well-known personalities-such as James Herriot&#39;s ``Cats are the connoisseurs of comfort&#39;&#39;-that will tickle the reader as they peruse this gem of a book.</p><p>Rachael Hale has won numerous awards for her animal portraiture. Since 1995 her images have been published on calendars, posters, greeting cards, and stationary in over 20 countries worldwide. She lives and works in Auckland, New Zealand, with her chocolate-brown Newfoundland named Henry.<br>Anyone who loves dogs knows that they have their own unique personalities-they may be brave or timid, placid or hyper-but they're always soulful. In this collection of 101 arresting four-color portraits, Hale manages to capture the essential doggishness of her subjects, whether it's Hamish the Chihuahua's minuscule, quizzical face or the quiet intelligence of Loki, a Staffordshire bull terrier mix, sitting patiently with a kitten on his head. Though there are a few gratuitous props-a knitted cap on a Gordon setter, a pearl necklace on a Chinese Crested-the photographs don't descend into the realm of the kitschy and too-cute, partly because the dogs' expressive faces are the focus of the compositions. Hale tosses a few relevant quotes into the mix as well, e.g., Walt Whitman's "The dog is the god of frolic," and P.G. Wodehouse's "It is fatal to let any dog know that he is funny, for he immediately loses his head and starts hamming it up." The appendix, which gives a brief description of each dog's story, adds dimension to the photographs. We learn, for example, that Jabba, an eight-year-old pit bull, is just as shy as she looks. During the shoot, Hale says, she "ran terrified from the room...frightened by a fly." <br>Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Herbert James Draper: A Life Study</h2><p>Herbert Draper was one of the most successful painters of classical mythologies and elegant portraits, in the period between the turn of the Twentieth Century and the advent of the First World War. His pictures are the archetypes of the Victorian classical revival; dramatic and sensually charged subjects of beautiful maidens and dynamic heroes. Neglected for over half a century, Draper&#39;s work has finally been reassessed. He is now regarded as one of the last great painters of classical narratives in late Victorian and Edwardian Britain. Herbert Draper: A Life Study is the first study of Draper&#39;s art and life, largely based on previously unstudied material in private archives. Many of the pictures reproduced in this book for the first time are now in private collections and have not been exhibited since Draper&#39;s death.</p><p>Simon Toll graduated from Warwick University in 1997 with an honours degree in Art History and now works for Sotheby&#39;s.

The scope and significance of his work have had a lasting effect not only in several fields of philosophy but also in mathematics, the history and philosophy of science, and the theory of signs, as well as in literary and cultural studies. Largely obscure until after his death, Peirce&#39;s life has long been a subject of interest and dispute. Unfortunately, previous biographies often confuse as much as they clarify crucial matters in Peirce&#39;s story. Ketner&#39;s new biographical project is remarkable not only for its entertaining aspects but also for its illuminating insights into Peirce&#39;s life, his thought, and the intellectual milieu in which he worked.</p><p>Kenneth Laine Ketner is the Charles Sanders Peirce Professor of Philosophy at Texas Tech University and the director of its Institute for Studies in Pragmaticism. He is editor of several works by and about Peirce and was co-organizer of the Charles S. Peirce International Congress held at Harvard in 1989. He is also one of the two principals in a noteworthy volume of correspondence with Walker Percy (<i>A Thief of Peirce: The Letters of Kenneth Laine Ketner and Walker Percy</i>, published in 1995).Framed as an ``autobiography'' full of deliberate fictional creations, this life of Pragmatisms founding genius is a breathtakingly original attempt to reinvent the dry habitudes of biography. Unfortunately, it is also an epic, perplexing failure. The first of an anticipated three volumes, this account takes us, in a jittering, wildly idiosyncratic way, through the first 28 years (childhood and schooling) of Peirces life. In the frame-tale manner so popular in the 19th-century novel, Ketner (Philosophy/Texas Tech Univ., A Thief of Peirce: The Letters of Kenneth Laine Ketner and Walker Percy, not reviewed) has created a labyrinth of multiple narrations. First off, there is fictional interpolator Ike Eisenstaat, a writer of detective stories. Digging through a box that his wife, Betsey Darbey, inherited, he comes across Peirces fragmentary autobiography, which he then proceeds to flesh out with additional notes, anecdotes, commentary, etc. Then there are the explications of Peirces philosophy, provided by his centenarian student, LeRoi Wyttynys. The autobiography as such consists of Ketners clever, but impossibly fragmentary, compilation and distillation of autobiographical snippets from Peirces various writings. Peirce was one of the 19th centurys great minds; his influence on everything from philosophy to semiotics has been enormous. But he is not well served here. The general effect is confusion and tedium. Ketner knows his subject almost too well, forgetting that the general reader, especially given the complexity of Peirces thought, needs a more straightforward grounding, at least intermittently. The author does dig up some interesting tidbits, including a secret first marriage, and convincingly traces, as much as his disjointed structure allows, the early beginnings of Peirces ideas. But as much as one wants to salute this audacious project, Ketners style, sensibility, and methodology dont rise to the occasion, begging the ultimate question, ``Why?''

Evanzz is a journalist who spent 15 years researching the case; Friedly is a researcher at the Martin Luther King Jr. Papers Project at Stanford University. Evanzz builds a strong case for the conspiracy theory, while Friedly gives it very little credence. Evanzz also delves more deeply into African American history and has interviewed over 200 individuals involved in the Black Power Movement. The "Judas" Evanzz refers to is John Ali, whom he concludes conspired with the CIA to assassinate his former friend. Friedly points out, however, that the New York City Police Department did a poor job of protecting Malcolm X and has yet to release its files of the case. Both authors clearly show that the CIA and FBI were concerned about Malcolm X's growing power, especially after he and Elijah Muhammad had gone their separate ways. The FBI was worried that Malcolm X and Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. were going to join forces, while the CIA was concerned about Malcolm X's visits to African leaders and what this might mean for American race relations. Since Evanzz and Friedly had access to more sources than previous authors, their studies add new insights into Malcolm X's life, death, and role in African American history. Both titles are essential for most libraries. Previewed in "Malcolm X: By Any Book Necessary," LJ 10/15/92.--Ed.<br><i>- Gary D. Barber, SUNY at Fredonia Lib.</i><br>Copyright 1993 Reed Business Information, Inc.Misleadingly titled, this book promises more than it delivers. Though a highly readable history of Malcolm X and the black nationalist movement, as an investigation it offers only circumstantial evidence--with relatively few new revelatons--about the role government security agents played in the events leading to Malcolm's assassination on Feb. 21, 1965. Freelance writer Evanzz, drawing on FBI files and a wide range of other sources, correctly criticizes the FBI's hasty conclusion that Malcolm's murder had no "international implications." Yet the facts that the FBI harassed Black Muslims and infiltrated the organization and that the CIA targeted Third World leaders like Fidel Castro and Patrice Lumumba do not necessarily justify Evanzz's conclusion that the intelligence community "probably" decided to kill Malcolm because of his plans to bring the plight of "the American Negro" before the United Nations. Evanzz tends to preface his chapters with portentous quotes that suggest he will reach more solid conclusions than he does.

Jackson is enlisted by the local matriarch to prove that her son is not responsible for the killing, an investigation that reveals a possible motive hidden among the area&#39;s oldest and most elite families. 50,000 first printing.</p><p>The late <b>Philip R. Craig</b> was the author of nineteen novels in the Martha's Vineyard Mystery series. A professor emeritus of English at Wheelock College in Boston, he loved the Vineyard and lived there year-round with his wife, Shirley.<b>Chapter 1</b><br><br>I was coming out of the Dock Street Coffee Shop at the foot of Main Street when I saw Sergeant Tony D'Agostine of the Edgartown PD step out of his cruiser and head in my direction. He apparently needed a caffeine hit to keep him going for the rest of his shift.<br><br>"What's up on the mean streets?" I asked.<br><br>"Well," he said, "Mickey Gomes escaped from jail last night and hasn't come back."<br><br>The county jail in Edgartown looks more like a nice big white house than a jail, and Mickey wasn't the first person to break out of it. None of the escapees ever stay escaped very long, though, because Martha's Vineyard is an island so there's only so far you can run and the police know most of the places you can hide.<br><br>"What do you mean he hasn't come back?" I asked.<br><br>"I mean that he's escaped several times in the last year, usually after supper. But he's always come back in time for breakfast. This time, though, a jailer noticed he was missing and our best guess is that when Mickey saw a bunch of cops wandering around the jail, he was afraid to come back so he went and hid."<br><br>"What's he in for?"<br><br>"Statutory rape. He got it on with a fifteen-year-old girl a couple of years ago. This escape isn't anything to worry about. He's not dangerous and we know where he is."<br><br>"Where's that?"<br><br>"Up in the woods by the girl's house. When he breaks out he spends the night with her. According to her parents, she's seven months pregnant with his child."<br><br>I did some fast calculating. "Sired on one of his jailbreaks, I take it."<br><br>"You take it right. She's seventeen now and he's twenty and they want to get hitched, but the honeymoon will have to wait until he does the extra time for breaking jail. He had bad luck getting nailed now because he only had a couple more weeks to serve. Mickey's not too bright, but then again he had no reason to think he'd get caught this time because he never got caught before."<br><br>"How come nobody noticed him escaping until now?"<br><br>"I hear two stories. First, that the prisoners complained about not having any privacy, so the jail keepers stopped checking up on them too closely; second, that the sheriff's wife ordered the surveillance cameras turned off so no one would catch her making whoopee with her favorite inmate. Anyway, just before they locked the cells for the night Mickey would put a fake head -- I saw it and it's a pretty cheesy one if you ask me -- on his pillow and then go down the hall to the john. Only instead of turning right and going into the toilet, he'd turn left and go out the window of a storage room. Somebody'd slipped him a screwdriver and he'd just take the screen off the window and leave. The next morning he'd come back and put the screen back on. All the prisoners knew about it, but none of the jail keepers did. He only got found out this time because a jailer happened to wander down the hall last night and find the storage room screen gone."<br><br>"And now all has been revealed."<br><br>"Some of it, anyway. Once the jail keepers found out he had escaped, the prisoners told them how he's been doing it for months. They thought it was pretty funny. I can see that you do, too."<br><br>"You'd better get yourself that coffee," I said. "You need to be wide-awake if you're going to bring in a hard case like Mickey Gomes."<br><br>f0 <br><br>"No problem," said Tony. "He'll be getting hungry about now, since he's missed breakfast. I don't think he'll hide very long."<br><br>"Keep me informed of the latest developments."<br><br>"Sure." Tony went into the coffee shop and I climbed into my old Land Cruiser and drove home. I'd forgotten to ask Tony how the Silencer case was going, but I figured that if they'd solved it he'd have told me.<br><br>Actually I thought there was a good chance that they'd never catch the Silencer because, in spite of his victims' outrage, looking for him probably got less police attention than any other case on the island. This was because the cops, like most of the other people on the Vineyard, including me, were much more sympathic toward the criminal than his victims. The cops couldn't admit this, of course, but their efforts to apprehend him were pretty feeble at best.<br><br>For the Silencer had become a folk hero by doing one incredibly popular if totally illegal thing: he destroyed the sound systems in those cars that came boom-boom-booming down the island's roads and streets, always with the windows rolled down, always heard approaching a mile away, always throbbing with ground-shaking bass notes, always offending everyone but the driver and people just like him. <br><br>Why such drivers always have their windows down and the volume turned as high as it will go is a mystery to all who don't engage in such sound production, and what to do about it is a constant, infuriating frustration to everyone but the drivers. Or it had been until the coming of the Silencer, who that spring had begun destroying the sound systems of some of the loudest cars on the island. He hadn't gotten them all, but he had gotten several and he was still getting them.<br><br>The car owners were, of course, furious, not to say out of hundreds of dollars per car, and were quick to accuse the island cops of incompetence for failing to capture the person who had soon and for the most part affectionately become known as the Silencer.<br><br>Or perhaps it was now plural Silencers, for speculation had it that copycat criminals were beginning to operate, since not only automobile sound systems were being destroyed but also those in the island's most infamously noisy houses. People whose parties were so loud and frequent that their neighbors rarely had a tranquil night were having their speakers and other music-making paraphernalia turned to toast; and great was their groaning and anger.<br><br>The fury of the Silencer's victims was almost, in fact, equal to the joy of everyone who no longer had to suffer the mind-blinding din of the onetime noisemakers.<br><br>Moralists wrote letters to the editors, arguing both sides of the issue. The police promised thorough investigations and went through the motions of making them. The victims raged and promised vengeance, and the Silencer worked on, striking where least expected, clothed in darkness, a wraith never seen or heard, and a hero to his people.<br><br>Of whom I was one. I loathe bass-booming cars and all other earsplitting modern music. My aversion to such art, in fact, had led some who know me to suspect that I, myself, was the Silencer. It was an honor I could not accept, however much it would have pleased me to do so, for I hadn't the slightest idea how the Silencer did his work.<br><br>That Vineyard summer was one of the quietest in memory, for by late June the decibel level of automobile radios and of weekend parties had been lowered considerably all over the island as drivers and hosts sought to avoid the keen-eared Silencer's attention.<br><br>At home I gave dark-eyed Zee a husbandly kiss and told her of my conversation with Tony D'Agostine. She laughed. "No wonder the Chief is losing his hair. First the Silencer and now this. The island is becoming a sitcom."<br><br>"Life's a jest," I agreed, "but not everyone's amused. The CHOA people are still in a rage about Ron Pierson's castle going up on North Neck."<br><br>Zee knew why: "CHOA people want Chappy to be a gated community where nobody can build a new house, especially one bigger than theirs."<br><br>Chappaquiddick, the peninsula on the southeast corner of Martha's Vineyard, is home to a few hundred people and some of the finest beaches and fishing spots on the East Coast. CHOA was the Chappaquiddick Home Owners Association, a well-heeled group intent on keeping their bucolic sometimes-island from being invaded by people like Ron Pierson. Or anyone else, for that matter. CHOA also opposed building bike paths for tourists, favored closing East Beach to fishermen and bathers, and, in general, would have preferred it if no one but they, themselves, ever took the little three-car On Time ferry that ran between Chappy Point and the Edgartown Memorial Wharf or drove to Norton's Point Beach, the two modes of getting to Chappy from the rest of Martha's Vineyard.<br><br>CHOA's most persistent voice belonged to Maud Mayhew, a lean and lank white-haired aristocrat who had outlasted three husbands and who loathed all changes that had taken place on the Vineyard since the early twentieth century. She belonged to the DAR and to most of the island's conservation organizations, the Garden Club, the Marshal Lea Foundation, CHOA, and probably several other groups of which I was unaware. She wrote almost weekly letters to the local papers protesting development on the Vineyard in general and Chappy in particular, and had something to say at every meeting of every civic or governmental group that might influence change. She had a face like a horse. <br><br>"You must admit that Pierson's Palace is going to change the skyline of the bluffs out on North Neck," I said.<br><br>Zee nodded. "That's for sure. I don't know how big that house is going to be when he finishes it, but it looks like more space than anybody'd ever need. What is it with these huge houses, anyway?"<br><br>"It's been going on forever," I said. "The richest Neanderthal probably had the biggest cave, and Minos had Knossos."<br><br>Neither one of us had ever seen Knossos, but we'd read about it and seen pictures. Someday we were going to have to leave Martha's Vineyard and go visit Europe. We were probably the only people on the island who'd never done that.<br><br>"Ron Pierson's place may end up bigger than Knossos," said Zee. "By the way, the word is that Ron Pierson has hired Ollie Mattes as a security man. Working nights to keep the lowlife away from the palace. I guess he didn't like having his windows smashed and he fears the anger of CHOA."<br><br>"I think CHOA people are the kind who will kill you in court or with looks at a cocktail party, not ambush you in a dark alley."<br><br>"Well, somebody trashed the palace's windows the other night, so now Ollie Mattes is on guard to prevent more of such stuff."<br><br>"I never thought of Ollie as the security man type," I said. I knew him as a whiner whose wife was long-suffering and whose landscaping business was down the tube because his clients complained that Ollie promised more than he delivered. Ollie was the kind of guy who never saw good in anything or anybody. Everything was tainted, stained, imperfect, worthy of criticism. He seemed permanently unhappy, snide, and suspicious. He was sure that life was a mean experience and that cynicism was the only realistic attitude to take toward it. He made me tired and I avoided him. But I felt sorry for him, too, when I thought of him at all. Like Grendel, he had the curse of Cain upon him and was doomed to journey forever joyless through the swamps of his world.<br><br>"Maybe Ron Pierson sees something in him that you don't," said Zee. "Maybe Ollie, being the kind of guy who always expects the worst, is just who you want for a watchman."<br><br>That hadn't occurred to me. Maybe there's a place for everyone, even the Ollie Matteses.<br><br>"To change to a happier subject," I said, "what say we to go for an evening sail tonight? After supper, for a couple of hours? The Shirley J hasn't been exercised in a while."<br><br>"Sounds good," said Zee, smiling, "and I'm sure the kids won't mind a bit."<br><br>The Shirley J was our eighteen-foot Herreshoff catboat. We kept it on a stake halfway between the Yacht Club and the Reading Room, two organizations that we had never been invited to join. We kept our dinghy on Collins Beach, chained to a piling of the Reading Room bulkhead so it couldn't be stolen by gentlemen sailors who needed a way to get back to their yachts late at night. I didn't mind their using the dinghy but I did object to them setting it adrift after they were through with it. After the third time local fishermen had found it heading to sea off the Edgartown lighthouse, I'd begun chaining it to the bulkhead. <br><br>That evening I rowed Zee and our kids out to the catboat. It had been a soft summer day, and the wind was warm and gentle from the southwest. There was barely a ripple on the waters of the harbor, but just enough wind for us to ghost out into Nantucket Sound and then watch the sun set as we reached Oak Bluffs.<br><br>Our son, Joshua, now in the second grade when not at sea, and Diana, his smaller sister, trailed fishing lines over the stern just in case a bluefish was there, and we had a lovely sail. Life on Martha's Vineyard seemed just fine.<br><br>As the night came down, we headed home, first on a long reach that took us almost to the Cape Pogue Gut before I began tacking back into Edgartown Harbor.<br><br>Thus it was that as we passed offshore of Pierson's Palace atop the North Neck cliffs of Chappaquiddick, Diana, the keen-eyed huntress, pointed through the thickening darkness and said, "What's that, Pa?"<br><br>The rest of us looked, but I saw nothing. "What did you see, Diana?"<br><br>"Something falling," said my daughter. "I can't see it now."<br><br>I stared at the cliffs and at the rocky beach below but still saw nothing. Just then a small gust of wind caught our sail and the Shirley J heeled and took my attention away from the shoreline.<br><br>We sailed on home under a fingernail moon and the night's first stars, and it wasn't until the following afternoon that I learned that Ollie Mattes had tumbled down the cliff below Pierson's Palace and broken his head on one of the rocks below. <br><br>A less important story was that the Silencer had struck again in Oak Bluffs, infuriating the houseful of college kids whose sound system had been melted, but delighting their neighbors.<br><br>Copyright � 2004 by Philip R.

For years the border was less distinct, with Mexicans crossing one way to visit family and friends and tourists crossing the other to roam the curio shops. But as times change, so do places like Nogales. The maquiladora industry has brought jobs, population growth, and environmental degradation to the Mexican side. A crackdown against undocumented immigrants has brought hundreds of Border Patrol agents and a 14-foot-tall steel wall to the U.S. side. Drug smuggling has brought violence to both sides. Neither Nogales will ever be the same.<br><br> In <i>Lives on the Line</i>, Miriam Davidson tells five true stories from these border cities to show the real-life effects that the maquiladora boom and the law enforcement crackdown have had on the people of "Ambos (Both) Nogales." Readers will meet Yolanda S�nchez, a single mother who came to work in the factories; Jimmy Teyechea, a cancer victim who became an outspoken environmental activist; Dario Miranda Valenzuela, an undocumented immigrant who was shot and killed by a U.S. Border Patrol agent; Cristina, a "tunnel kid" who aspired to flee the gang lifestyle; and Hope Torres and Tom Higgins, maquiladora managers who have made unique contributions to the community.<br><br> In sharing these stories of people transformed by love and faith, by pain and loss, Davidson relates their experiences to larger issues and shows that, although life on the border is tough, it is not without hope. <i>Lives on the Line</i> is an impassioned look at the changes that have swept the U.S.-Mexico border: the rising tension concerning free trade and militarization, the growing disparity between the affluent and the impoverished. At the same time, the book highlights the positive aspects of change, revealing challenges and opportunities not only for the people who live on the border but for all Americans.</p><p>Miriam Davidson is a freelance journalist and writer whose credits include the <i>New York Times, Christian Science Monitor, The Nation,</i> and <i>The Progressive</i>."Davidson's journalistic eye captures the legacy of squalor and misery that greed and irresponsibility have created along the borderlands. There is nothing new in this, but the stories Davidson tells form a textbook on just how closely woven even and good, banality and heroism can be. . . . Ambos Nogales has something to teach all of us, and Davidson shares these lessons well." &#x2014;<i>National Catholic Reporter</i><br><br> "She offers hope for progress in the troubled region with her detailed reports on charitable church projects and progressive corporate policies that are helping to alleviate suffering and reduce antagonism. Timely and compelling." &#x2014;<i>Booklist</i><br><br> "Her book examines the impact of the maquiladoras on two towns on either side of the border . . . and condemns industry and the Mexican government for forgetting workers in the pursuit of profits. . . . But in the end, the stories that stand out the most are her vivid portraits of those who have been left behind by economic progress." &#x2014;<i>New York Times Book Review</i><br><br> "This book by American journalist Davidson is a vivid portrait of what is happening in the twin border towns of Nogales in Arizona and Sonora, Mexico-the US's Berlin Wall. . . . This gripping book should be read by all ages and belongs in all libraries." &#x2014;<i>Choice</i><br><br> "A rare glimpse into the personal stories of life and death on the razor's edge in a contrary bordertown. . . . Her impassioned writing and acute investigative talents reveal the human faces often lost to the attention focused on increasing political rhetoric and now-commonplace headlines of tragedy." &#x2014;<i>Bloomsbury Review</i></p><h2>High Country (Anna Pigeon Mysteries)</h2><p>When four young seasonal park employees at Yosemite National Park mysteriously vanish without a trace, Anna Pigeon is sent in to work undercover at the park&#39;s historical Ahwahnee Hotel to uncover the truth, but as her investigation into a pervasive evil permeating the region progresses, she finds her own life on the line. 125,000 first printing.</p><p>When four young employees of Yosemite National Park disappear, ranger Anna Pigeon goes undercover as a waitress at the Ahwahnee Lodge to investigate. Living in the staff dorm, she soon discovers there's a connection between at least one of the missing girls, a crashed plane containing a fortune in drugs, and the outsiders who've moved into the tent cabin last occupied by a skilled climber who's also among the disappeared. The first attempt on her life doesn't scare her away, but the second is nearly fatal, and Anna's harrowing escape keeps the tension ratcheted up until the denouement. As usual, Nevada Barr turns in a well-paced thriller featuring a compelling protagonist and a strong cast of minor characters, but it's her brilliantly etched landscapes that bring readers back to this popular series again and again. <i>High Country</i> is Anna's thirteenth outing, and it's one of her strongest. <i>--Jane Adams</i>Nevada Barr is the award-winning author of eleven previous Anna Pigeon mysteries, including the <i>New York Times</i> bestsellers <i>Flashback</i> and <i>Hunting Season</i>, as well as <i>Seeking Enlightenment . . .

A strong narrative and excellent sense of place pervades the newest outing in this good--and getting better--series, but what matters almost as much is the music both the author and his hero love, which reveals itself in the nicely cadenced prose and a plot featuring the old Delta blues men Atkins admiringly portrays. It all makes for an enjoyable evening of reading that would have been even better if they'd shipped a CD of the music Nick and his creator like best along with it. <i>--Jane Adams</i>Ace Atkins, an Alabama native, earned nominations for the Pulitzer Prize and the Livingston Award for his work covering crime at the <i>Tampa Tribune</i>.

It remains one of the most erudite yet accessible tours of the Egyptian royal tombs, a solid record of treasures now in peril from the depredations of tourists and the changing Nile valley climate. Not only does the distinguished Swiss Egyptologist make the tomb paintings real for readers by use of plans and 151 color plates, he also captures the panoply of ancient Egyptian belief and its impact on daily life by explicating the passages from the Books of the Dead which the paintings depict. Producing an English-text edition at this time is especially crucial; it cautions the world to pay heed to jewels it is about to lose. Intended for the lay public, it is also of interest to the scholar for its cogent discussion of ancient Egyptian thought.<br><i>- Jo-Ann D.

Within a matter of three months, however, the beleaguered ships were totally wiped out.<br>Captain Walter Winslow, a naval aviator on board the USS <i>Houston</i>, flagship of the U.S. Asiatic Fleet, was in a unique position to tell the riveting story. As an active participant in all the major battles the fleet engaged in, he had an intimate understanding of the calamities that befell it. In addition, he drew upon the his own extensive notes he kept from a POW camp while interviewing other American, British, Dutch, and Australian prisoners from the Allied fleet. Winslow also painstakingly tracked down war documents and battle reports from all the ships assigned to the fleet to paint a complete picture filled with graphic details of the fleet's only victory at Balikpapan; the disastrous Battle of the Java Sea that broke the back of the combined Asiatic fleet; the ghastly spectacle at Sunda Strait where the <i>Houston</i> struggled to survive; the suspenseful episode in the submarine <i>Perch</i> trapped in the mud at the bottom of the sea; and the daring escape from Corregidor of eighteen<br><br>crewmembers from the USS <i>Quail</i> who refused to surrender to the Japanese forces.</p><p></p><h2>Pan American&#39;s Ocean Clippers (Flying Classics Series)</h2><p>A history of the seaplanes used by PanAm Sikorskys, Martins and the final glorious Boeings.

John Falconer, a hero readers can believe in, was introduced in Book 3, The Noble Fugitive. Along with Book 4, The Night Angel, these last three novels of the series can be appreciated on their own. John Falconer, known to most as simply Falconer, is a large, powerfully built man whose gentle spirit shines through the physical and emotional scars of his previous life as a slave trader. His redemption has brought him full circle to the anti-slavery cause and a personal mission to free every slave he possibly can. After the events recounted in The Night Angel, Falconer settles in a Moravian community on the Underground Railroad. He cherishes his new wife, Ada, and her son, Matt, whom he loves as his own. Falconer finally has discovered peace, within and without. When the unimaginable happens, he and Matt face a loss so searing they can barely endure another day. Falconer finds himself back on board ship&#x2014;this time with a father's responsibilities and an assignment of rescue rather than capture. His course takes him from the eastern seaboard of America to France, from Marseilles to the shores of North Africa. But enormous danger, risk of failure and even death challenge him on the high seas and in the desert&#x2019;s strongholds. He has conquered many of life's storms, but none as vast as this.

It is 1943 in the backwoods of Mississippi. In the land of honeysuckle and wild grapevine, Jewel Hilburn and her husband Leston -- whose love for his wife is the surest comfort she's ever known -- are truly blessed. They have five fine children who embrace the world as though it were a sumptuous table set for a feast; and when Brenda Kay is born, Jewel gives thanks for yet another healthy baby, last-born and most welcome. <i>Jewel</i> is the story of how quickly a life can change; how, like lightning, an unforeseen event can illuminate our lives and set us on a course without reason or compass. All too soon, Jewel knows that something is wrong with Brenda Kay; her every moment, every breath is taken up with caring for her daughter, with setting things straight. Leston's optimism is failing as fast as the Southern postwar economy. And the physicians Jewel calls "crack doctors" insist that no one can fix a brain born without the gift of common sense. Against a stunning tableau reminiscent of John Steinbeck's <i>The Grapes of Wrath,</i> the uniquely talented Bret Lott traces the intricate changes among the members of the Hilburn family as Jewel deepens her quarrel with God, taking hold of the hardships that come her way. Jewel sees one hope for them; they must travel to a new life in the Promised Land of California.... We will wait a very long time before another writer matches the intensity and the beauty of this mother-daughter relationship. <i>Jewel</i> stands as an unforgettable masterwork, in which Bret Lott has created one of the finest and most indomitable heroines of contemporary American fiction.</p><p>The year is 1943 and life is good for Jewel Hilburn, her husband, Leston, and their five children. Although there's a war on, the Mississippi economy is booming, providing plenty of business for the hardworking family. And even the news that eldest son James has enlisted is mitigated by the fact that Jewel, now pushing 40, is pregnant with one last child. Her joy is slightly clouded, however, when her childhood friend Cathedral arrives at the door with a troubling prophecy: "I say unto you that the baby you be carrying be yo' hardship, be yo' test in this world. This be my prophesying unto you, Miss Jewel." <p> When the child is finally born, it seems that Cathedral's prediction was empty: the baby appears normal in every way. As the months go by, however, Jewel becomes increasingly afraid that something is wrong with little Brenda Kay--she doesn't cry, she doesn't roll over, she's hardly ever awake. Eventually husband and wife take the baby to the doctor and are informed that she is a "Mongolian Idiot," not expected to live past the age of 2. Jewel angrily rebuffs the doctor's suggestion that they institutionalize Brenda Kay. Instead the Hilburns shoulder the burdens--and discover the unexpected joys--of living with a Down's syndrome child. </p><p> Bret Lott has written a novel that spans decades, follows the lives of several characters, and cuts back and forth between Mississippi and California. Given these challenges, a lesser writer might lose focus. Lott, however, has wisely chosen to keep his eye trained on Jewel--a narrator who is smart, perceptive, and above all, honest. He has also bucked the trend toward political correctness by allowing his characters to think, feel, and talk the way white Mississippians of that era would have. ("Mongolian Idiot," "nigger," "cracker," and "buck" are just a few of the epithets sprinkled throughout the text.) The language may be discomforting to some readers. Few will deny, however, that Bret Lott has crafted a clan that is all heart in this bittersweet paean to the enduring strength of familial love. <i>--Margaret Prior</i></p>Bret Lott has a gift for making the ordinary seem luminous. In <i>Jewel,</i> he applies his art to a broad canvas and produces what may stand as his masterpiece....Lott matches the honest strength of his characters with that of his prose. His Jewel is a force of nature, her story rising out of a perfect, seamless union of teller and tale.</p><h2>Shuck Beans, Stack Cakes, and Honest Fried Chicken: The Heart and Soul of Southern Country Kitchens</h2><p>Here is the first regional American cookbook to offer a true taste of the Mountain South.

McDaniel's Oscar win raised hopes that theentertainment industry was finally ready to createmore respectful, multidimensional roles for blacks.But under the aegis of studio heads eager to pleaseSoutherners, screenwriters kept churning out rolesthat denigrated the African-American experience.</p><p>Where McDaniel's stature and popularity shouldhave increased after Selznick's masterpiece cameout, as was the case for her white counterparts, hersdeclined, as an increasingly politicized black audienceturned against her. "I'd rather play a maid than be amaid," is how McDaniel answered her critics. Yet herflippant response belied a woman whose hardscrabblebackground rendered her emotionally conflictedabout the roles she accepted. Here, at last, in a finelytuned biography by Jill Watts, is her story.</p><p>Watts, a highly praised researcher and writer,shares little-known aspects of McDaniel's life, fromher dealings with Hollywood's power brokers andblack political organizations to her successful civilrights battle to integrate a Los Angeles neighborhood,revealing a woman hailed by Ebony as anachiever of "more firsts in Hollywood" than anyother black entertainer of her time.</p></p><p><p>A professor of history at California State University and the coordinator of the film studies program at California State University, San Marcos, <strong>Jill Watts</strong> has written two previous books, <strong>God, Harlem U.S.A.: The Father Divine Story</strong> and <strong>Mae West: An Icon in Black and White</strong>. She lives in San Marcos, California.</p>In her imperfect yet fascinating biography, Watts (<i>Mae West</i>) unveils the largely tragic tale of Hattie McDaniel, the first African-American to win an Academy Award. Born in 1893, the youngest daughter of freed slaves, McDaniel sang and danced to help provide for her poverty-stricken family. Her early career as a comedian and singer garnered raves. She landed in Hollywood, appearing as an extra in scores of early 1930s films. Soon speaking roles in films like <i>Stella Dallas</i> led to her Oscar-winning performance as Mammy in the 1939 epic <i>Gone with the Wind</i>. This achievement marked the pinnacle of McDaniel's career&#x2014;and heralded its collapse. Despite the complexity of her portrayal, McDaniel became typecast as the affable, disgruntled or tippling domestic. Although she'd educated herself , dressed elegantly and became involved in a range of political and social issues, McDaniel was hampered by studios that presented her as an eye-rolling, dialect-speaking Jemima. Watts's strength lies in her explication of the political and social conflicts in which McDaniel was embroiled. Yet her illumination of the complex actress herself is weak; she only comes alive in the book's final chapters. Nevertheless, Watts has crafted a compelling, disturbing history of blacks in early Hollywood. Photos. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Her first book might have been a revelatory treatise on plant life. <i>Lab Girl</i> is that, but it is also so much more. Because in it, Jahren also shares with us her inspiring life story, in prose that takes your breath away. <br><i>Lab Girl</i> is a book about work, about love, and about the mountains that can be moved when those two things come together. It is told through Jahren's remarkable stories: about the things she's discovered in her lab, as well as how she got there; about her childhood--hours of unfettered play in her father's laboratory; about how she found a sanctuary in science, and learned to perform lab work "with both the heart and the hands"; about a brilliant and wounded man named Bill, who became her loyal colleague and best friend; about their adventurous, sometimes rogue research trips, which take them from the Midwest all across the United States and over the Atlantic, from the ever-light skies of the North Pole to tropical Hawaii; and about her constant striving to do and be the best she could, never allowing personal or professional obstacles to cloud her dedication to her work. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jahren's insights on nature enliven every page of this book. <i>Lab Girl</i> allows us to see with clear eyes the beautiful, sophisticated mechanisms within every leaf, blade of grass, and flower petal, and also the power within ourselves to face--with bravery and conviction--life's ultimate challenge: discovering who you are.<br><i>From the Hardcover edition.</i></p><p><strong>An Amazon Best Book of April 2016:</strong> I was doubtful that I would like this book. While I appreciate a beautiful flower as much as the next city-girl, the thought of reading a whole book about a geobiologist-- a scientist who spends her life studying plants, trees, soils as well as flowers--made me want to run to the nearest dysfunctional family memoir about crazy parents and their wounded children. But Hope Jahren won me over very quickly. Somehow she knows me: &#x201c;the average person [who] cannot imagine himself staring at dirt for longer than the twenty seconds needed to pick up whatever object he just dropped.&#x201d; And she doesn&#x2019;t judge. Instead, she just tells her story, which, it turns out has a lot to do with plants and science, of course--her father was a scientist, she basically grew up in a lab, and taking long walks through nature was the way she communed with her reticent Scandinavian American parents--but also has a lot to do with other things. Like life, for instance, and friendship and passion and love, for ideas, for work and for all living beings, including--shocker!--people. Surely many readers will feel as I did that the story of her relationship with Bill, her physically and emotionally damaged lab partner, is at the heart of this wonderful story; it&#x2019;s unusual, it&#x2019;s inspiring and it doesn&#x2019;t fit neatly into the little window box we think we&#x2019;re supposed to favor. And if Jahren can surprise you about all that messy human stuff, just think how she can change your feelings about dirt. <em>--Sara Nelson</em>HOPE JAHREN is an award-winning scientist who has been pursuing independent research in paleobiology since 1996, when she completed her PhD at UC Berkeley and began teaching and researching first at the Georgia Institute of Technology and then at Johns Hopkins University.

Based on 14 years' research that embraced more than 50,000 letters and papers and interviews with 150 people, this portrait captures every phase from birth to death of "the quintessential American voice." Considerable background material is supplied on the history of Sandburg's times and personal influences. Presenting the man and his accomplishments objectively, Niven quotes extensively from evaluations of Sandburg's work, both effusive and more critical. His fortunate marriage to Paula Steichen, sister of the photographer Edward Steichen, brought three daughters and a partner whose name was the last spoken word on his lips. One is left with the impression that his multi-volumed biography of Abraham Lincoln was probably his greatest achievement, at least the one that brought national fame and acclaim; however, his many other facets are carefully delineated in this labor of love and fine scholarship.<br><i>- Addie Lee Bracy, Beaver Coll. Lib., Glenside, Pa.</i><br>Copyright 1991 Reed Business Information, Inc.Attacked though he may have been by some literary critics, Sandburg (1878-1967) captured in his rugged free verse the varied substance and rhythms of American life more fully, says Niven, than any poet of his time. He was a vagabond poet, a minstrel of democracy, a champion in verse and prose of the rights of the working class, his poems deeply felt rather than cerebral. Backed by the author's seven years of research, this major biography presents this son of immigrant Swedes in his roles as hobo, soldier, journalist, orator, socialist, biographer of Abraham Lincoln and poet. Freelance writer Niven covers his long, fruitful life, and his happy marriage to Paula Steichen, in elegant prose that captures the sweep of his development as poet and man. Her book is a fine achievement.

Surround Job with loose fists, malicious boots, and cold, gallon wine. Invite the Macbeths over for drinks. Add a lame dog named Scupper Pit and you've got the raw ingredients of David Adams Richards's <i>Mercy Among the Children</i>. Set in an isolated, wind-besieged house with bullet holes in the tarpaper walls, Richards's novel wonders-- pointedly, beautifully--whether goodness is merely a luxury.<p> At the age of 12, having borne more suffering in his child's body than any adult should endure, Sydney Henderson vows never to harm another human soul. Turning his back on the violent alcoholism of his upbringing, self-educated Sydney wins the honest respect of the beautiful Elly and the children they bear. Honest respect, however, is rarely a match for fear and base human opportunism. Manipulated, attacked, and abused by a small community eager for a scapegoat, Sydney loses his job, the health of his wife, and, most importantly, the respect of his son Lyle. "There is no worse flaw in man's character," Richards knows, "than that of wanting to belong."</p><p> The superb, controlled, and unapologetic <i>Mercy Among the Children</i> is nothing less than an inquiry into human strength. Richards uses the crack of ribs on a frigid night to remind us of the opportunistic populism of much so- called morality. <i>Mercy</i>, which shared Canada's premier fiction award, the Giller Prize, with Michael Ondaatje's <i>Anil's Ghost</i>, combines the hound dog's attention to locale of fellow Maritimer Alistair MacLeod with the quotidian insight of countryman Timothy Findley's <i>The Wars</i>, especially its reminder that the emotions behind war also drive fights over who should scrub the dinner dishes. <i>--Darryl Whetter</i></p><strong>David Adams Richards</strong> has won numerous awards for his fiction and nonfiction.

At its heart were the leaders of the three great powers - Woodrow Wilson, Lloyd George and Clemenceau. Kings, prime ministers and foreign ministers with their crowds of advisers rubbed shoulders with journalists and lobbyists for a hundred causes - from Armenian independence to women&#39;s rights. Everyone had business in Paris that year - T.E. Lawrence, Queen Marie of Romania, Maynard Keynes, Ho Chi Minh. There had never been anything like it before, and there never has been since. For six extraordinary months the city was effectively the centre of world government as the peacemakers wound up bankrupt empires and created new countries. They pushed Russia to the sidelines, alienated China and dismissed the Arabs, struggled with the problems of Kosovo, of the Kurds, and of a homeland for the Jews. The peacemakers, so it has been said, failed dismally; failed above all to prevent another war. Margaret MacMillan argues that they have unfairly been made scapegoats for the mistakes of those who came later. They tried to be evenhanded, but their goals - to make defeated countries pay without destroying them, to satisfy impossible nationalist dreams, to prevent the spread of Bolshevism and to establish a world order based on democracy and reason - could not be achieved by diplomacy.

Discoveries from San Lorenzo, El Manati, Monte Alban, Tikal and Copan are included and the chapter on the enigamtic Olmecs - the putative &#34;mother culture&#34; of Mesoamerica - has been expanded.</p><p>Mary Ellen Miller is Professor of History of Art at Yale University. She has written many articles on Mesoamerican art for learned journals, and her book with Linda Schele, The Blood of Kings, is considered a landmark in Maya studies. She is also the author, with Karl Taube, of The Gods and Symbols of Ancient Mexico and the Maya.This third edition of a noted pre-Columbian art history book will satisfy various types of readers, including travelers, armchair archaeologists, museum goers, and art history students. Inspired by new discoveries in archaeology and by major museum exhibitions, Miller (history of art, Yale) covers Mesoamerica's broad range of cultures, from Olmec to Aztec; geographic areas, including Mexico, Guatemala, Honduras, Belize, and the Yucat n; and time periods, from archaic to postclassic. She explains how architecture, sculpture, painting, and ceramics relate to the dynamic forces of advance and decline within each culture and pays special attention to recent hieroglyphic decipherments and evidence for dating. The publication is enhanced by 193 pages of illustrations and beautiful color photography on quality paper. This book's trade paperback format make it ideal to take on vacation or to a museum.

Pratchett&#39;s wackiness collaborates with Gaiman&#39;s morbid humor; the result is a humanist delight to be savored and reread again and again. You see, there was a bit of a mixup when the Antichrist was born, due in part to the machinations of Crowley, who did not so much fall as saunter downwards, and in part to the mysterious ways as manifested in the form of a part-time rare book dealer, an angel named Aziraphale. Like top agents everywhere, they&#39;ve long had more in common with each other than the sides they represent, or the conflict they are nominally engaged in. The only person who knows how it will all end is Agnes Nutter, a witch whose prophecies all come true, if one can only manage to decipher them. The minor characters along the way (Famine makes an appearance as diet crazes, no-calorie food and anorexia epidemics) are as much fun as the story as a whole, which adds up to one of those rare books which is enormous fun to read the first time, and the second time, and the third time..."A Superbly funny book.

J. Parker's phenomenal Akitada mystery series has been gaining fans with each new novel. The latest, <i>The Convict's Sword</i>, is the most fully realized installment to date, weaving history, drama, mystery, romance, and adventure into a story of passion and redemption. Lord Sugawara Akitada, the senior secretary in the Ministry of Justice, must find the mysterious killer of a man condemned to live in exile for a crime he did not commit. Meanwhile, Akitada's retainer, Tora, investigates the sudden death of a blind street singer, whose past life is a bigger mystery than anyone thought. Told in Parker's clever, vivid prose, <i>The Convict's Sword</i> is a must-read for those who love well-written mysteries in an exotic setting.</p><p>I. J.

In Parker's compelling fifth mystery set in feudal Japan (after 2007's <i>Island of Exiles</i>), Sugawara Akitada, now a senior secretary in the ministry of justice, suffers guilt over his failure to fulfill his promise to Haseo, a recently deceased convict who saved his life in an earlier book, to exonerate him. As Akitada makes some small progress toward finding the truth about the five-year-old murders Haseo was blamed for, he must also clear his own retainer, Tora, of the murder of a blind street singer. His inquiries on both fronts come at a time of increasing tension with his wife, Tamako, and as an outbreak of smallpox disrupts the capital city, Heian-Kyo. A capricious and unreliable boss, Soga, adds to his woes. Besides smoothly mixing action and deduction, Parker gives her protagonist an emotional depth that raises her to the front rank of contemporary historical writers, including Laura Joh Rowland, the author of a similar series set in 17th-century Japan (<i>The Fire Kimono</i>, etc.). <i>(Aug.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Raised in a conservative Catholic family, Shozan went on to study philosophy (becoming&nbsp; de-Catholicized in the process) and to pursue a career as a screenwriter and stand-up comic in the clubs of L.A. How he went from life in the fast lane to life on the stationary meditation cushion is the subject of this laugh-out-loud funny account of his experiences. Whether he's dealing with the pranks of a juvenile delinquent assistant in the monastery kitchen or defending himself against claims that he appeared in a porno movie under the name "Daniel Reed" (he didn't, really) or being surprised in the midst of it all by the compassion he experiences in the presence of his teacher, Haubner's voice is one you'll be compelled to listen to. Not only because it's highly entertaining, but because of its remarkable insight into the human condition.</p><p>Shozan Jack Haubner is the pen name of a Zen monk whose humorous essays have appeared in <i>Tricycle</i>, <i>Buddhadharma</i>, the <i>Shambhala Sun</i>, and <i>The Sun</i>, as well as in the Best Buddhist Writing series.

Greek Fire is his second novel, following on from his remarkable debut, Dissolution.Matthew Shardlake, the marvelous hunchbacked 16th-century attorney who first appeared in Sansom's <i>Dissolution</i>, returns in this spellbinding Tudor-era tale of murder, conspiracy and betrayal. Shardlake normally handles property cases and the occasional dangerous mission for Lord Thomas Cromwell, the king's high counselor. Now he is engaged to defend a young woman accused of a curious murder, and the case seems hopeless. The girl refuses to speak and, under English law, unless she offers a plea in court she will be slowly crushed to death. Cromwell offers Shardlake a two-week stay of execution if he will agree to undertake a secret mission. Desperate to save the girl's life, Shardlake agrees. Rumors abound of a new and terrifying weapon called Greek Fire, and Cromwell orders Shardlake to find it, along with its secret formula and the two alchemists who possess it. Before Shardlake can even speak to the alchemists, they are brutally murdered, the formula and Greek Fire go missing, and horror and death are unleashed. Fortunately, Shardlake is aided by Jack Barak, a capable rogue working for Cromwell, and his old friend, Guy Malton, a peculiar apothecary. Sansom's vivid portrayal of squalid, stinking, bustling London; the city's wealth and poverty; the brutality and righteousness of religious persecution; and the complexities of English law make this a suspenseful, colorful and compelling tale. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

His novels The Tenth Justice, Dead Even and The First Counsel were all New York Times bestsellers. He is the current writer of Justice League of America. Rags Morales is the fan-favourite artist of Hawkman and JSA.This seven-issue miniseries by bestselling author Meltzer (<i>The Zero Game</i>) was both wildly popular and reviled, and the collection shows that both views have merit. It <i>does</i> knock the rust off scores of DC characters while opening avenues to explore post-9/11 morality. On the other hand, it trashes the roles of characters whom readers have come to consider old friends and tampers outrageously with years' worth of continuity. The story begins shockingly when the wife of the minor super hero Elongated Man is brutally murdered. Things get increasingly serious as other members of the Justice League of America find that their loved ones are targets. The super villains are a lot nastier than they used to be; the heroes, meanwhile, are forced to admit that they could have been responsible for some of what's gone wrong when they started tampering with the minds of villains who deserved it or even fellow heroes who merely disapproved of the idea. This makes familiar heroes more morally ambiguous;more human;and the old, easy trust is lost, with long-term consequences still to be revealed in future DC story lines. In the meantime, Meltzer's script and Bair's inking of Morales's penciled art serves the realistic aspect of the characters very well, making this book a genuine comics landmark. <i>(Sept.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

For some estates, original landscape designs and floorplans are provided, plus illustrations highlighting features such as staircases, fireplaces and ceiling paintings. Readers familiar with the region will recognize Washington Irving's Tudor farmhouse, Sunnyside, and the historical Van Cortlandt Manor House in Croton-on-Hudson, but will be certain to make some new discoveries such as the underground chambers at Rockefeller's Kykuit mansion and the eerie ruins of Bennerman's Castle on deserted Pollepel Island.

As usual, Gloria was eating. Dougless shifted her slim legs to try to make herself more comfortable around Gloria's luggage. There were six large pieces of matched leather luggage to hold Gloria's belongings, and since they wouldn't fit in the trunk of the little car, they were piled in the back with Dougless. There was a makeup case under her feet and a big wardrobe on the seat beside her. Every time she moved, she scraped against a buckle, a welt, or a handle. Right now, she had an itch under her left knee, but she couldn't reach it. </p><p> "Daddy," Gloria whined, sounding like an invalid four-year-old, "she's scratching the pretty suitcases you bought me." </p><p> Dougless clenched her fists, closed her eyes, and counted to ten. <i>She.</i> Gloria never said Dougless's name, but just called her <i>She.</i> </p><p> Robert glanced over his shoulder at Dougless. "Dougless, could you please be a bit more careful? That luggage is quite expensive." </p><p> "I am aware of that," Dougless said, trying to keep the anger out of her voice. "It's just that I'm having a difficult time sitting back here. There isn't much room." </p><p> Robert gave a great sigh of weariness. "Dougless, do you have to complain about everything? Can't you even allow a vacation to be pleasant? All I asked was that you make an effort." </p><p> Dougless opened her mouth to reply but closed it. She didn't want to start another argument. Besides, she knew that it would do no good. So, instead of replying, she swallowed her anger -- then rubbed her stomach. It was hurting again. She wanted to ask Robert to stop to get something to drink so she could take one of the tranquilizers the doctor had prescribed for her nervous stomach. "Keep this up and you'll give yourself an ulcer," the doctor had warned her. But Dougless wouldn't give Gloria the satisfaction of knowing that she'd yet again managed to upset Dougless and to, yet again, drive a wedge between Dougless and Robert. </p><p> But when Dougless glanced up, she saw Gloria smirking at her in the makeup mirror on the sun visor. With determination, Dougless looked away and tried to concentrate on the beauty of the English countryside. </p><p> Outside the car window she saw green fields, old stone fences, cows and more cows, picturesque little houses, magnificent mansions, and...and Gloria, she thought. Dougless seemed to see Gloria everywhere. Robert kept saying, "She's just a child and her daddy has left her. It's only natural that she's going to have some hostility toward you. But please try to show some sympathy for her, will you? She's really a sweet kid when you get to know her." </p><p> A sweet kid, Dougless thought as she looked out the window. At thirteen, Gloria wore more makeup than Dougless did at twenty-six -- and Gloria spent hours in the hotel bathroom applying it. Gloria sat in the front of the car. "She's just a kid and it's her first trip to England," Robert said. "And you've been to England before, so why not be generous?" That Dougless was supposed to read the road map when she could hardly see around Gloria's head didn't seem to count for much. </p><p> Dougless tried to concentrate on the scenery. Robert said Dougless was jealous of his daughter. He said that she didn't want to share him with anyone else, but that if she'd just relax, they'd be a very happy threesome. "We could be a second family for a little girl who has lost so much," he said. </p><p> Dougless had tried to like Gloria. She'd tried hard to be an adult and ignore, and even understand, Gloria's hostility, but it was more than Dougless could do. In the year she and Robert had been living together, Dougless had made every possible effort to find that "sweet kid" that Robert had told her of. Several times, she'd taken Gloria shopping and spent more money on Gloria than Dougless's small elementary school teacher's salary allowed her to spend on herself. Several Saturday nights Dougless had stayed at the house she shared with Robert, babysitting Gloria while he went to professional functions, usually cocktail parties or dinners. When Dougless had said she'd like to attend with him, Robert had said, "But time alone is what you two need. You need to get to know each other. And, remember, babe, I'm a package deal. Love me, love my kid." </p><p> Sometimes Dougless had started to believe that it was beginning to work because she and Gloria were cordial, even friendly, to each other when they were alone. But the minute Robert appeared, Gloria changed into a whining, lying brat. She sat on Robert's lap, all five foot two inches, one hundred and forty pounds of her, and wailed that <i>She</i> had been "awfully mean" to her. </p><p> At first Dougless had laughed at what Gloria was saying. How absurd to think she would ever harm a child! Anyone could see that the girl was just trying to get her father's attention. </p><p> But to Dougless's utter disbelief, Robert believed every word his daughter said. He didn't accuse Dougless. No, instead, he just asked her to be a "little kinder" to "the poor kid." Immediately, Dougless's defenses had gone up. "Is that supposed to mean you don't think I'm a kind person? You <i>do</i> think I would mistreat a child?" </p><p> "I'm just asking you to be the adult and have a little patience and understanding, that's all." </p><p> When Dougless asked what he meant by that, Robert had thrown up his hands and said that he couldn't talk to her; then he'd walked out of the room. Dougless had taken two of her stomach tranquilizers. </p><p> After the arguments, Dougless had wavered between guilt and rage. She had a classroom of children who adored her, yet Gloria seemed to hate her. <i>Was</i> Dougless jealous? Was she somehow unconsciously letting this child know she didn't want to share Robert with his own daughter? Every time Dougless thought of her possible jealousy she vowed to try harder to make Gloria like her, which usually meant she bought Gloria another expensive gift. And she'd again agree to babysit on the weekends when Gloria stayed with them. While Gloria's mother had a <i>life,</i> Dougless thought with bitterness. </p><p> At other times, all Dougless felt was rage. Couldn't Robert just once -- <i>one</i> time -- take Dougless's side? Couldn't he tell Gloria that Dougless's comfort was more important than the blasted suitcases? Or maybe he could tell Gloria that Dougless had a name and wasn't always to be referred to as <i>she</i> or <i>her?</i> But every time Dougless said something like that to Robert, she ended up apologizing. Robert said, "My God, Dougless, you're the adult. And I only see her on alternate weekends, so of course I'm going to favor her over you. You and I are together every day, so why can't you stand to play second fiddle now and then?" </p><p> His words sounded right, but at the same time, Dougless fantasized about Robert telling his daughter to "be more respectful" toward the "woman I love." </p><p> But that didn't happen, so Dougless kept her mouth shut and enjoyed the time she and Robert had when Gloria wasn't around. When Gloria wasn't with them, she and Robert were perfectly suited, and she knew, through age old intuition, that very soon she was going to receive what she wanted so much: a marriage proposal. </p><p> Truthfully, marriage was what Dougless wanted most in life. She'd never been burning with ambition the way her older sisters were. Dougless just wanted a nice home and a husband, and a few children. Maybe someday, after the kids were in school, she'd write children's books, something about talking animals, but she had no desire to fight her way up a corporate ladder. </p><p> Already, she'd invested eighteen months of her life in Robert, and he was perfect husband material. He was tall, handsome, well-dressed, and an excellent orthopedic surgeon. He always hung up his clothes, and he helped with the housework; he didn't chase after women, and he always came home when he said he would. He was reliable, dependable, faithful -- but, most important, he needed her so very much. </p><p> Not long after they met, Robert had told Dougless his life story. As a child, he hadn't been loved very much, and he told Dougless that her sweet, generous heart was what he'd been looking for all his life. His first wife, whom he'd divorced over four years ago, was a cold fish, a woman who Robert said was incapable of love. Just three months after he met Dougless, he told her he wanted a "permanent relationship" with her -- which she took to mean marriage -- but first he wanted to know how they "related" to each other. After all, he'd been hurt so badly the first time. In other words, he wanted them to live together. </p><p> What he said made sense to her, and since Dougless had had a number of "unfortunate" previous relationships with men, she happily moved into Robert's big, beautiful, expensive house, then set about doing everything she could to prove to Robert that she was as warm and generous and loving as his mother and wife had been cold. </p><p> With the exception of dealing with Gloria, living with Robert had been great. He was an energetic man and they often went dancing, hiking, bicycle riding. They entertained a great deal and often went to parties. She'd never lived with a man before, but she had easily settled into a domestic routine, feeling as though it was what she was made for. </p><p> They had problems other than Gloria, of course, but Robert was so much better than any of the other men Dougless had dated that she forgave him his little quirks -- most of which revolved around money. True, it was annoying that when they went to the grocery together he nearly always "forgot" his checkbook. And at the ticket window of theaters and when the check was presented in restaurants, half the time Robert found he'd left his wallet at home. If Dougless complained, he'd talk to her about the new age of liberated women and how most women were fighting to pay half the expenses. Then he'd kiss her sweetly and take her somewhere expensive for dinner -- and he'd pay. And Dougless forgave him. </p><p> Dougless knew she could stand the small problems -- everyone had idiosyncracies -- but it was Gloria that sent her screaming. When Gloria was with them, their life turned into a battleground. According to Robert, his daughter was perfection on earth, and because Dougless didn't see her that way, Robert began to see Dougless as the enemy. When the three of them were together, it was Robert and Gloria on one team and Dougless on the other. </p><p> Now, on this holiday in England, in the front seat Gloria offered her father a piece of candy from the box on her lap. Neither of them seemed to think of offering any to Dougless. </p><p> Still looking out the window, Dougless gritted her teeth. Perhaps it was the combination of Gloria and money that was making her so angry, because, with this trip, Robert's little "money quirk" as Dougless had always thought of it, had turned into something more. </p><p> When Dougless had first met Robert, they had talked for hours about their dreams and they'd talked many times of taking a trip to England. As a child, she had often traveled to England with her family, but she hadn't been back in years. When she and Robert had moved in together, in September of last year, Robert had said, "Let's go to England one year from today. By then we'll know." He hadn't elaborated on what they would "know," but Dougless was sure that he meant that, in a year, they'd know whether or not they were compatible for marriage. </p><p> For a whole year, Dougless had worked on planning the trip, which she'd come to think of as their honeymoon. A "pre-honeymoon," she called it in her mind. "The decision maker," she said to herself, then smiled. She made reservations at the most romantic, most exclusive country house hotels England had to offer. When she had asked Robert's opinion of a hotel, he'd winked at her and said, "Spare no expense for this trip." She had ordered brochures, bought travel books, read and researched until she knew the names of half the villages in England. Robert's only stipulation had been that he wanted an educational trip as well as fun, so she'd compiled a list of many things to do that were close to their lovely hotels -- which was easy to do, since Great Britain is like a Disneyland for history lovers. </p><p> Then, three months before they were to leave, Robert said that he had a surprise for her on this trip, a very, very special surprise that was going to fill her with joy. His words had made Dougless work even harder on the plans, and she found their little game of secrecy exciting. As Dougless planned, she thought, Will he propose here? Or maybe here. This place would be nice. </p><p> Three weeks before they left, she was balancing Robert's household-accounts checkbook when she saw a canceled check for five thousand dollars made out to a jewelry store. </p><p> As she held the check, tears of happiness came to her eyes. "An engagement ring," she'd whispered. That Robert had spent so much was proof that even though he was a tad stingy on small things, when something really counted, he was generous. </p><p> For the next few weeks Dougless had walked on clouds. She cooked wonderful meals for Robert and had been especially energetic in the bedroom, doing everything she could think of to please him. </p><p> Two days before they were to leave, Robert punctured her bubble a bit -- not enough to burst it, but it had certainly been deflated. He had asked to see the bills for the trip, plane tickets, advance reservations, whatever she had. He had then added the amounts and handed her the calculator tape. </p><p> "This is your half of the cost," he'd said. </p><p> "Mine?" she'd asked stupidly, not understanding what he was saying. </p><p> "I know how important it is to you women today to pay your own way, so I don't want to be accused of being a male chauvinist pig," he'd said with a smile. "You don't want to be a burden to a man, do you? You don't want to add to all my responsibilities at the hospital and to my ex-wife, do you?" </p><p> "No, no, of course not," Dougless had mumbled, feeling confused, as she often did when confronted with Robert's reasoning. "It's just that I don't have any money." </p><p> "Dougless, baby, please tell me that you don't spend everything you make. Maybe you should take a course in accounting." He lowered his voice. "But then your family has money, doesn't it?" </p><p> That was one of the times Dougless's stomach had begun to hurt, and she remembered the doctor's warning about giving herself an ulcer. She had explained to Robert about her family a hundred times. Yes, her family had money -- lots of it -- but her father believed his daughters should know how to support themselves, so Dougless was on her own until she was thirty-five; then she'd inherit. She knew that if there was an emergency, her father would help her, but a pleasure trip to England hardly counted as an emergency. </p><p> "Come on, Dougless," Robert had said with a smile when Dougless didn't reply to his question. "I keep hearing what a paragon of love and support that family of yours is, so why can't they help you now?" Before she could speak, Robert raised her hand to hi...</p></p><h2>The Journals of Sylvia Plath</h2><p>No other major contemporary American writer has inspired such intense curiosity about her life as Sylvia Plath.

But his free-spirited, insubordinate ways soon got him tagged as a possible enemy of La Patrie, and he was summarily tossed into a French concentration camp at La Ferte-Mace in Normandy. Under the vilest conditions, Cummings found fulfillment of his ever elusive quest for freedom. <b>The Enormous Room</b>, his account of his four-month confinement, reads like a latter-day Pilgrim's Progress, a journey into dispossession, to a place among the most debased and deprived of human creatures. Cummings's hopeful tone reflects the essential paradox of his existence: to lose everything is to become free, and so to be saved.<p>For more than seventy years, Penguin has been the leading publisher of classic literature in the English-speaking world.

Educated at Harvard, in 1917 he moved to Greenwich Village in New York City and began to write poetry and paint. In June of that year he went to France as a Red Cross volunteer with the ambulance corps and was soon arrested and imprisoned, though not charged with a crime, in a French concentration camp. That experience inspired his autobiographical novel, <b>The Enormous Room</b>, which was published in 1922. The next year <b>Tulips and Chimneys</b>, the first of his many volumes of poetry, appeared. It is for his typographically creative poetry that he is best known, but Cummings also painted and wrote expressionist verse drama and prose.

Le Guin's Earthsea Cycle</p><p> Now a SCI FI Original Miniseries!</p> <p> When young Tenar is chosen as high priestess to the ancient and nameless Powers of the Earth, everything is taken away from her-home, family, possessions, even her name. She is now known only as Arha, the Eaten One, guardian of the labyrinthine Tombs of Atuan, shrouded in darkness. When a young wizard, Ged Sparrowhawk, comes to steal the Tombs' greatest hidden treasure, the Ring of Erreth-Akbe, Tenar's rightful duty is to protect the Tombs. But Ged also brings with him the light of magic and tales of a brighter world Tenar has never known. Will Tenar risk everything to escape the darkness that has become her domain? </p><p> With millions of copies sold worldwide, Ursula K. Le Guin's Earthsea Cycle has earned a treasured place on the shelves of fantasy lovers everywhere, alongside the works of such beloved authors as J. R. R. Tolkien and C. S. Lewis.</p></p><p>Often compared to Tolkien's Middle-earth or Lewis's Narnia, Ursula K. Le Guin's Earthsea is a stunning fantasy world that grabs quickly at our hearts, pulling us deeply into its imaginary realms. Four books (<i>A Wizard of Earthsea</i>, <i>The Tombs of Atuan</i>, <i>The Farthest Shore</i>, and <i>Tehanu</i>) tell the whole Earthsea cycle--a tale about a reckless, awkward boy named Sparrowhawk who becomes a wizard's apprentice after the wizard reveals Sparrowhawk's true name. The boy comes to realize that his fate may be far more important than he ever dreamed possible. Le Guin challenges her readers to think about the power of language, how in the act of naming the world around us we actually create that world. Teens, especially, will be inspired by the way Le Guin allows her characters to evolve and grow into their own powers. <p> In this second book of Le Guin's Earthsea series, readers will meet Tenar, a priestess to the "Nameless Ones" who guard the catacombs of the Tombs of Atuan. Only Tenar knows the passageways of this dark labyrinth, and only <b>she</b> can lead the young wizard Sparrowhawk, who stumbles into its maze, to the greatest treasure of all. Will she?</p>Ursula K.

The windswept world of Earthsea is one of the greatest creations in all fantasy literature, frequently compared with J.R.R. Tolkien's <i>Middle Earth</i> or C.S. Lewis'<i>Narnia</i>. The magnificent saga begins with <i>A Wizard Of Earthsea</i>, continues in <i>The Tombs Of Atuan</i> and <i>The Farthest Shore</i>, and concludes with <i>Tehanu</i> --each book a treasure of wisdom, wonder, and literary wizardry. When she was still a child, Tenar was stripped of her name and family and dedicated as high priestess to the Nameless Ones, dark powers of <i>The Tombs of Atuan</i>. This is the tale of the young wizard, Ged, who came to the forbidden labyrinth to steal its greatest treasure--the Ring of Erreth-Akbe--and stayed to set Tenar free and lead her out of darkness.</p><h2>My Fellow Prisoners</h2><p>There is the guard who delivers blows with no visible traces.

Eight years and two turbulent presidential terms later, he left on a train. Those years, among the most prosperous in American history, saw America transformed not only by growth in transportation but by the expansion of the market economy and the formation of the mass political party. Jackson's ambivalence&#x2014;and that of his followers&#x2014;toward the new politics and the new economy is the story of this book.<br><br>Historians have often depicted the Old Hero (or Old Hickory) as bigger than life&#x2014;so prominent that his name was wed to an era. Donald Cole presents a different Jackson, one not always sure of himself and more controlled by than in control of the political and economic forces of his age. He portrays Jackson as a leader who yearned for the agrarian past but was also entranced by the future of a growing market economy. The dominant theme of Jackson's presidency, Cole argues, was his inconsistent and unsuccessful battle to resist market revolution.<br><br>Elected by a broad coalition of interest groups, Jackson battled constantly not only his opponents but also his supporters. He spent most of his first term rearranging his administration and contending with Congress. His accomplishments were mostly negative&#x2014;relocating Indians, vetoing road bills and the Bank bill, and opposing nullification. The greatest achievement of his administration, the rise of the mass political party, was more the work of advisers than of Jackson himself.<br><br>He did, however, make a lasting imprint, Cole contends. Through his strength, passions, and especially his anxiety, Jackson symbolized the ambivalence of his fellow Americans at a decisive moment&#x2014;a time when the country was struggling with the conflict between the ideals of the Revolution and the realities of nineteenth-century capitalism.</p><p>&#39;This book is gracefully and interestingly written and presents an insightful synthesis of the political, social, and economic changes that were transforming Jacksonian America.&#39; - James Roger Sharp, Syracuse UniversityDonald B.

Murder on the Luistania is the first novel in that series. A playwright with a lifelong interest in history, he lives in England.Following Murder on the Lusitania, this second of the series set on great ocean liners of the early 20th century is sure to delight nautical history enthusiasts as well as mystery fans. American George Porter Dillman and English beauty Genevieve Masefield are now working for the Cunard Line as detectives on the Mauretania, the largest ship in the world. Setting sail on its maiden voyage from Liverpool to New York, the ship carries more than 2,000 passengers and a record shipment of gold bullion stored in its hold. While Masefield, posing as a first-class passenger, socializes and observes the elite, Dillman seeks the culprit responsible for several silver thefts from second-class passengers. The prime suspect, Max Hirsch, disappears on the day of a violent storm. Did someone push him overboard? And who later steals some of the gold bullion? Dillman and Masefield, innocently helped by eight-year-old Alexandra Jarvis and the ship's mascot, a black cat named Bobo, turn up some truly surprising answers. From the opulent, glittering images of first class to the crowded quarters of the hopeful immigrants in steerage, Allen vividly renders the class structure of the early 20th century. Of particular note are the dialogue and social banter of Masefield's upper-class friends. Combined with the puzzling mystery, the careful attention to historic details and well-developed characters make for first-class entertainment. <br>Copyright 2000 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Orthodox Study Bible: New Testament and Psalms</h2><p><p>For the first time, English-speaking Orthodox Christians have an edition of the New Testament and Psalms that offers Bible study aids written from the Orthodox perspective.

Douglas MacArthur changed the course of World War II.

Borneman is so skilled at conveying, and exploring how personality and ego translate into military successes and failures.<br><br>Architect of stunning triumphs and inexplicable defeats, General MacArthur is the most intriguing military leader of the twentieth century. There was never any middle ground with MacArthur. This in-depth study of the most critical period of his career shows how MacArthur's influence spread far beyond the war-torn Pacific.</p><p>Walter R. Borneman is the author of eight works of nonfiction, including <em>The Admirals, 1812, The French and Indian War</em>, and <em>Polk</em>. He holds both a master's degree in history and a law degree.

Our fascination with travel has never been so well represented as in this new addition to the Best American series: a wide-ranging compendium of the best travel writing published in 1999, culled from more than three hundred magazines, newspapers, and Web sites.<br> This first collection of THE BEST AMERICAN TRAVEL WRITING reads like a good novel. Best-selling author Bill Bryson and series editor Jason Wilson have put together a book that will surprise knowledgeable travelers and entrance newcomers with the glories of new worlds. Articles by such well-loved writers as Bill Buford and Ryszard Kapuscinski are included, as are those by exciting new voices. Ranging across myriad landscapes, from Central Park in New York City to the Ouadane oasis in Saharan Mauritania, THE BEST AMERICAN TRAVEL WRITING 2000 showcases the diversity and creative power of travel writing today.</p><p>The world may be getting smaller, but that doesn't mean it's any less varied, surprising, or exotic--as is made evident by the 25 essays collected in the inaugural edition of the Best American Travel Writing series. In search of America's sharpest, most original, and often, most curious travel writers, editor Bill Bryson and series editor Jason Wilson sifted through hundreds of stories. What the resulting collection demonstrates is that, as Wilson writes, travel stories matter: <blockquote>Having a travel writer report on particular things, small things, the specific ways in which people act and interact, is perhaps our best way of getting beyond the clich�s that we tell each other about different places and cultures, and about ourselves.</blockquote> And, as Bryson notes, many of the freshest voices are being drawn to foreign subjects far beyond the trampled paths of tourism. Within these pages, they chart the world from Nantucket to Zanzibar, the Atlas Mountains of Morocco to Australia's Cape York Peninsula with originality and keen observation. Some even go where none would follow: drawn by the allure of danger zones, Patrick Symmes rides a dirt bike to "perhaps the most forbidden city in the world" in search of the Khmer Rouge. Tim Cahill describes his own personal journey in hell--11 long days on a barge on the Ubangi River with 3,000 people packed so close together it's impossible to move without apologizing. (Fortunately, he's befriended by a man named God who is always in the know.) <p> Distance is not a prerequisite for travel writing, though humor is invaluable, as Bill Buford shows in his attempt to do what you just don't do--spend the night in Central Park. When Dave Eggers discovers hitchhiking is what makes Cuba move, it becomes the point of his trip to "pick up and move people, from here to there." Tongue in cheek, he declares, "So easy to change the quality, the very direction, of Cubans' lives!" Then again, sometimes humor is just not appropriate, particularly if you've been kidnapped by Ugandan rebels (as was Mark Ross) or you're trying to help the Dalai Lama choose the next Panchen Lama without jeopardizing lives (as did Isabel Hilton). In any case, it's all happening here--golf in Greenland, cheese smuggling from France, even a ride with the Toughest Truck Driver in the World. This collection proves that travel writing is a genre whose time has come. <i>--Lesley Reed</i></p><p>JASON WILSON is the author of <i>Godforsaken Grapes: A Slightly Tipsy Journey through the World of Strange, Obscure, and Underappreciated Wine</i> and&nbsp;<i>Boozehound: On the Trail of the Rare, the Obscure, and the Overrated in Spirits. </i>He writes regularly for the <i>Washington Post</i> and the <i>New York Times</i>.

A first novel. 15,000 first printing.</p><p>Diane Glancy teaches literature and writing at Macalester College in St. Paul, Minnesota.Poet, dramatist, short-story writer and essayist Glancy (winner of an American Book Award for Claiming Breath) turns her talents to the novel, recreating in this bone-true tale the sorrow, struggle and betrayal suffered by the Cherokee along the Trail of Tears. In the winter of 1838-39, 13,000 Cherokee were forced to walk the Trail of Tears from North Carolina toward the "new territory" of present-day Oklahoma. Following the Native American belief that many voices are needed to tell a story, Glancy employs a multitude of narrators. There are the voices of Cherokee of all ages and clans, of white soldiers and preachers, and snatches from actual historical records. The central narrator, Maritole, emerges to tell her personal story of "pushing the bear," a dark heavy burden of anger, impending madness, physical distress and, above all, doubt in herself and her heritage as she perseveres in the grueling walk. Maritole's shaky relationship with her husband, and the deaths of her baby and parents, push her into a relationship with a white soldier, Sergeant Williams. Ultimately, however, he can't fathom the Cherokees' mystic, symbiotic relationships with the land and with each other. At times, the novel proceeds as slowly as the march itself, but it rewards the reader with a visceral, honest presentation of the Cherokee conception of story as the indestructible chain linking people, earth and ancestry?a link that becomes, if not unmitigated salvation, then certainly a salve to the spirit. (<i>Publishers Weekly</i> )<br><br>First novelist Glancy (Claiming Breath, LJ 3/92) prefaces her stunning narrative with a stark statement of fact: "From November 1838 to March 1839 some 11,000 to 13,000 Cherokee walked 900 miles in bitter cold from the southeast to Indian Territory. One fourth died or disappeared along the way." Drawing on these statistics and other surviving documentation, the author imaginatively re-creates a nearly unimaginable experience: the forced removal of the Cherokee peoples from their homes in four Southern states. The story is told in many voices, principally those of the uprooted-Native men and women, conjurers, Christians, politicians, leaders, and rebels?but also heard are the white soldiers, settlers, evangelists, sympathizers, oppressors, and opportunists who witnessed their passage to what is now Oklahoma. The fictional testimony creates a graphic and compelling mosaic of human tragedy. Highly recommended. (<i>Library Journal - Starr E. Smith, Marymount Univ. Lib., Arlington, Va.</i> )</p><h2>New York Days</h2><p>The author describes his years as the youngest-ever editor-in-chief of &#34;Harper&#39;s,&#34; recounting how he rubbed elbows with the likes of Woody Allen and Robert Kennedy</p><p>In New York Days, the long-awaited sequel to the prize-winning North Toward Home, Willie Morris recalls his triumphant, exciting, and ultimately devastating years as the youngest ever editor-in-chief of Harper&#39;s, America&#39;s oldest magazine, when he was at the center of the nation&#39;s stunning cosmos of writing, publishing, politics, and the arts. It was the 1960s, when New York City was a place &#34;throbbing with possibility&#34; and &#34;in which everyone seemed to know everyone else and where everything of importance seemed to happen first&#34;. These were Willie Morris&#39;s New York days - with William Styron, David Halberstam, Woody Allen, Bobby Kennedy, Truman Capote, Shirley MacLaine, George Plimpton, Leonard Bernstein, and the other leading figures of the time. For he knew them all: the writers, the poets, the intellectuals, the editors, the actresses, the tycoons, the detectives, the athletes, and not a few fakirs and charlatans. He wined with Sinatra at the Players Club and eavesdropped in the trattorias on the Mob; sat next to DiMaggio in the Garden ringside seats and spent evenings at Elaine&#39;s. And during the day, Morris worked to transform Harper&#39;s from an uninspired literary magazine to its apex as the groundbreaking political and cultural voice of the &#39;60s, until the editorial rift and the mass resignations of 1971 - possibly the most notable dispute in American publishing history. New York Days is a portrait of an era, but it is also a poignant, deeply personal yet universal story of a man&#39;s life: a man who attains everything he has ever hoped for only to realize that what he has sacrificed is even greater. For in the process of reaching the pinnacle of his career, Morris also experiencedprofound loss: the dissolution of his marriage and the breakdown of the magazine as he helped create it. Now, from a vantage point of more than twenty years and a thousand miles, Morris asks his younger self: &#34;Where on earth, fast-moving boy, are you going now?&#34; And what, if anything, did it all mean? Beautifully written with bittersweet lyricism and exuberant humor, New York Days captures the spirit of the &#39;60s: the dazzling parties, the fervent intellectualism, and the sense of slowly decaying idealism as the country plunged deeper into a tragic war and intensifying social chaos. And in the midst of this scene is Willie Morris, exalted, exhilarated, and eventually almost consumed by his brilliant, electric, enervating New York days.Willie Morris (1934-1999) was the award-winning author of many books, including &#34;North Toward Home&#34;, &#34;My Dog Skip&#34;, and &#34;After All, It&#39;s Only a Game&#34;.</p><h2>THE KITE RUNNER: Exclusive Collector&#39;s Edition</h2><p>Used.

He limited his practice to breast cancer surgery in the 1980s and was the founding medical director of Oklahoma's first multidisciplinary breast clinic at his alma mater where he was also named as the first holder of the G.

And just as his travels informed his fiction, his novelists's sensibility is apparent in each of these pieces.

They like it when celebrities are involved,and when the players are nobodies from nowheresville. Fundamentally,they want their pleasures snatched from the vine like stolen fruit.

The theory goes like this: Just a few centuries after Christ s death, around the time the Roman Empire converted to Christianity, the true Faith suffered a catastrophic falling-away. The simple truths of the gospel became so obscured by worldliness and pagan idolatry kicking off the Dark Ages of Catholicism that Christianity required a complete reboot. This idea of a Great Apostasy is one of the cornerstones of American Protestantism, along with Mormonism, the Jehovah s Witnesses, and even Islam. Countless millions today profess a faith built on the assumption that the early Church quickly became broken beyond repair, requiring some new prophet or reformer to restore the pure teaching of Jesus and the apostles. This theory is popular... but it s also fiction. In The Apostasy that Wasn t, Rod Bennett follows up his bestseller Four Witnesses with an account of the historical events that led him out of his own belief in apostasy theory and into the Catholic Church. With the touch of a master storyteller, he narrates the drama of the early Church s fight to preserve Christian orthodoxy intact even as powerful forces try to smash it to pieces. Amid imperial intrigue, military menace, and bitter theological debate, a hero arises in the form of a homely little monk named Athanasius, who stands against the world to prove that there could never be a Great Apostasy because Jesus promised his Church would never be broken.</p><p>Rod Bennett was, for many years, the editor of Wonder Magazine, a popular Christian media journal. His writings have appeared in other national publications as well, ranging from Rutherford and Gadfly to Catholic Exchange and Our Sunday Visitor. Rod has appeared on many well-known radio and television programs such as The Journey Home and Bookmark. His first book, Four Witnesses: The Early Church in Her Own Words, is a best seller from Ignatius Press. He also edited Why Catholic Bibles Are Bigger with apologist Gary Michuta and compiled Chesterton s America. A convert from the Southern Baptist faith, Rod joined the Catholic Church in 1996. He lives in Atlanta with his wife Dorothy and their two children.To read this book is to live in the fourth century, for a vivid moment, knowing the thrills and heroics to which true faith led our ancestors.

At the heart of the story is double-entry bookkeeping: the first system that allowed merchants to actually measure the worth of their businesses. Luca Pacioli&#x2015;monk, mathematician, alchemist, and friend of Leonardo da Vinci&#x2015;incorporated Arabic mathematics to formulate a system that could work across all trades and nations. As Jane Gleeson-White reveals, double-entry accounting was nothing short of revolutionary: it fueled the Renaissance, enabled capitalism to flourish, and created the global economy. John Maynard Keynes would use it to calculate GDP, the measure of a nation&#x2019;s wealth. Yet double-entry accounting has had its failures. With the costs of sudden corporate collapses such as Enron and Lehman Brothers, and its disregard of environmental and human costs, the time may have come to re-create it for the future.</p><p>Jane Gleeson-White is the author of Double Entry: How the Merchants of Venice Created Modern Finance, which won the 2012 Waverley Library Award for Literature.

BOMC Alt.</p><p>Naturalist and bioacoustics researcher Katy Payne stood near an elephant cage at a zoo and felt a strange "throb and flutter" in the air. When she later realized that the feeling was very like that caused by the lowest notes of a pipe organ, she embarked on a journey of scientific and personal discovery that took her to Africa to study how the huge mammals communicate. For years, she lived close to the elephants she loved, getting to know individuals and describing their long-distance infrasound "conversations." After her fifth such expedition, one third of the elephant population she was studying was killed in a planned cull by the Zimbabwean government. Whether or not you accept Payne's hypothesis that elephants are extraordinarily intelligent and capable of communicating with each other and with other species (including humans), you will find her descriptions of the animals compelling and compassionate. Her grief at the loss of her elephant friends is palpable, and she uses it to utmost effect in decrying not only the ivory trade, but the way in which humans have decided to live on the planet. <i>--Therese Littleton</i><b>Katy Payne's</b> is work as an acoustic biologist has attracted international attention, first for her studies of the songs of humpback whales, then for her seminal work on elephant communication. She has written for <i>National Geographic, Natural History, American Scientist,</i> the <i>Los Angeis Times,</i> and many other publications. Her children's book, <i>Elephants Calling,</i> was selected as an outstanding book of 1992 by the National Science Teathers' Association. A frequent lecturer on conservation and on animal behavior and communication she is currently a Visiting Fellow at Cornell University's Bioacoustic Research Program. She lives in Ithaca, New York, and is the mother of four children.</p><h2>After Dark (Thorndike Press Large Print Basic Series)</h2><p>Two sisters--Eri, a fashion model sleeping her way to oblivion, and Mari, a young student--form the center of a novel that documents a series of encounters in Tokyo during the witching hours between midnight and dawn.</p><p>Haruki Murakami was born in Kyoto in 1949 and now lives near Tokyo. His work has been translated into 38 languages. The most recent of his many honors is the Franz Kafka Prize, whose previous recipients include Elfriede Jelinek and Harold Pinter.<b>Chapter One: 11:56 p.m.<br><br></b>Eyes mark the shape of the city. <br><br>Through the eyes of a high-flying night bird, we take in the scene from midair. In our broad sweep, the city looks like a single gigantic creature&#x2014;or more like a single collective entity created by many intertwining organisms. Countless arteries stretch to the ends of its elusive body, circulating a continuous supply of fresh blood cells, sending out new data and collecting the old, sending out new consumables and collecting the old, sending out new contradictions and collecting the old. To the rhythm of its pulsing, all parts of the body flicker and flare up and squirm. Midnight is approaching, and while the peak of activity has passed, the basal metabolism that maintains life continues undiminished, producing the basso continuo of the city&#x2019;s moan, a monotonous sound that neither rises nor falls but is pregnant with foreboding.<br><br>Our line of sight chooses an area of concentrated brightness and, focusing there, silently descends to it&#x2014;a sea of neon colors. They call this place an &#x201c;amusement district.&#x201d; The giant digital screens fastened to the sides of buildings fall silent as midnight approaches, but loudspeakers on storefronts keep pumping out exaggerated hip-hop bass lines. A large game center crammed with young people; wild electronic sounds; a group of college students spilling out from a bar; teenage girls with brilliant bleached hair, healthy legs thrusting out from micromini skirts; dark-suited men racing across diagonal crosswalks for the last trains to the suburbs. Even at this hour, the karaoke club pitchmen keep shouting for customers. A flashy black station wagon drifts down the street as if taking stock of the district through its black-tinted windows. The car looks like a deep-sea creature with specialized skin and organs. Two young policemen patrol the street with tense expressions, but no one seems to notice them. The district plays by its own rules at a time like this. The season is late autumn. No wind is blowing, but the air carries a chill. The date is just about to change.<br>We are inside a Denny&#x2019;s.<br><br>Unremarkable but adequate lighting; expressionless decor and dinnerware; floor plan designed to the last detail by management engineers; innocuous background music at low volume; staff meticulously trained to deal with customers by the book: &#x201c;Welcome to Denny&#x2019;s.&#x201d; Everything about the restaurant is anonymous and interchangeable. And almost every seat is filled.<br><br>After a quick survey of the interior, our eyes come to rest on a girl sitting by the front window. Why her? Why not someone else? Hard to say. But, for some reason, she attracts our attention&#x2014;very naturally. She sits at a four-person table, reading a book. Hooded gray parka, blue jeans, yellow sneakers faded from repeated washing. On the back of the chair next to her hangs a varsity jacket. This, too, is far from new. She is probably college freshman age, though an air of high school still clings to her. Hair black, short, and straight. Little makeup, no jewelry. Small, slender face. Black-rimmed glasses. Every now and then, an earnest wrinkle forms between her brows.<br><br>She reads with great concentration. Her eyes rarely move from the pages of her book&#x2014;a thick hardback. A bookstore wrapper hides the title from us. Judging from her intent expression, the book might contain challenging subject matter. Far from skimming, she seems to be biting off and chewing it one line at a time.<br><br>On her table is a coffee cup. And an ashtray. Next to the ashtray, a navy blue baseball cap with a Boston Red Sox &#x201c;B.&#x201d; It might be a little too large for her head. A brown leather shoulder bag rests on the seat next to her. It bulges as if its contents had been thrown in on the spur of the moment. She reaches out at regular intervals and brings the coffee cup to her mouth, but she doesn&#x2019;t appear to be enjoying the flavor. She drinks because she has a cup of coffee in front of her: that is her role as a customer. At odd moments, she puts a cigarette between her lips and lights it with a plastic lighter. She narrows her eyes, releases an easy puff of smoke into the air, puts the cigarette into the ashtray, and then, as if to soothe an approaching headache, she strokes her temples with her fingertips.<br><br>The music playing at low volume is &#x201c;Go Away Little Girl&#x201d; by Percy Faith and His Orchestra. No one is listening, of course. Many different kinds of people are taking meals and drinking coffee in this late-night Denny&#x2019;s, but she is the only female there alone. She raises her face from her book now and then to glance at her watch, but she seems dissatisfied with the slow passage of time. Not that she appears to be waiting for anyone: she doesn&#x2019;t look around the restaurant or train her eyes on the front door. She just keeps reading her book, lighting an occasional cigarette, mechanically tipping back her coffee cup, and hoping for the time to pass a little faster. Needless to say, dawn will not be here for hours.<br><br>She breaks off her reading and looks outside. From this second-story window she can look down on the busy street. Even at a time like this, the street is bright enough and filled with people coming and going&#x2014;people with places to go and people with no place to go; people with a purpose and people with no purpose; people trying to hold time back and people trying to urge it forward. After a long, steady look at this jumbled street scene, she holds her breath for a moment and turns her eyes once again toward her book. She reaches for her coffee cup. Puffed no more than two or three times, her cigarette turns into a perfectly formed column of ash in the ashtray.<br>The electric door slides open and a lanky young man walks in. Short black leather coat, wrinkled olive-green chinos, brown work boots. Hair fairly long and tangled in places. Perhaps he has had no chance to wash it in some days. Perhaps he has just crawled out of the underbrush somewhere. Or perhaps he just finds it more natural and comfortable to have messy hair. His thinness makes him look less elegant than malnourished. A big black instrument case hangs from his shoulder. Wind instrument. He also holds a dirty tote bag at his side. It seems to be stuffed with sheet music and other assorted things. His right cheek bears an eye-catching scar. It is short and deep, as if the flesh has been gouged out by something sharp. Nothing else about him stands out. He is a very ordinary young man with the air of a nice&#x2014;but not very clever&#x2014;stray mutt.<br><br>The waitress on hostess duty shows him to a seat at the back of the restaurant. He passes the table of the girl with the book. A few steps beyond it, he comes to a halt as if a thought has struck him. He begins moving slowly backward as in a rewinding film, stopping at her table. He cocks his head and studies her face. He is trying to remember something, and much time goes by until he gets it. He seems like the type for whom everything takes time.<br><br>The girl senses his presence and raises her face from her book. She narrows her eyes and looks at the young man standing there. He is so tall, she seems to be looking far overhead. Their eyes meet. The young man smiles. His smile is meant to show he means no harm.<br>Sorry if I&#x2019;ve got the wrong person,&#x201d; he says, &#x201c;but aren&#x2019;t you Eri Asai&#x2019;s little sister?&#x201d;<br><br>She does not answer. She looks at him with eyes that could be looking at an overgrown bush in the corner of a garden.<br><br>&#x201c;We met once,&#x201d; he continues. &#x201c;Your name is . . . Yuri . . . sort of like your sister Eri&#x2019;s except the first syllable.&#x201d;<br><br>Keeping a cautious gaze fixed on him, she executes a concise factual correction: &#x201c;Mari.&#x201d;<br><br>He raises his index finger and says, &#x201c;That&#x2019;s it! Mari. Eri and Mari. Different first syllables. You don&#x2019;t remember me, do you?&#x201d;<br><br>Mari inclines her head slightly. This could mean either yes or no. She takes off her glasses and sets them down beside her coffee cup.<br><br>The waitress retraces her steps and asks, &#x201c;Are you together?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Uh-huh,&#x201d; he answers. &#x201c;We are.&#x201d;<br><br>She sets his menu on the table. He takes the seat across from Mari and puts his case on the seat next to his. A moment later he thinks to ask Mari, &#x201c;Mind if I sit here a while? I&#x2019;ll get out as soon as I&#x2019;m finished eating. I have to meet somebody.&#x201d;<br><br>Mari gives him a slight frown. &#x201c;Aren&#x2019;t you supposed to say that <i>before</i> you sit down?&#x201d;<br><br>He thinks about the meaning of her words. &#x201c;That I have to meet somebody?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;No . . . ,&#x201d; Mari says.<br><br>&#x201c;Oh, you mean as a matter of politeness.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Uh-huh.&#x201d;<br><br>He nods. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re right. I should have asked if it&#x2019;s okay to sit at your table. I&#x2019;m sorry. But the place is crowded, and I won&#x2019;t bother you for long. Do you mind?&#x201d;<br><br>Mari gives her shoulders a little shrug that seems to mean &#x201c;As you wish.&#x201d; He opens his menu and studies it.<br><br>&#x201c;Are you through eating?&#x201d; he asks.<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m not hungry.&#x201d;<br><br>With a scowl, he scans the menu, snaps it shut, and lays it on the table. &#x201c;I really don&#x2019;t have to open the menu,&#x201d; he says. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m just faking it.&#x201d;<br><br>Mari doesn&#x2019;t say anything.<br><br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t eat anything but chicken salad here. Ever. If you ask me, the only thing worth eating at Denny&#x2019;s is the chicken salad. I&#x2019;ve had just about everything on the menu. Have you ever tried their chicken salad?&#x201d;<br><br>Mari shakes her head.<br><br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s not bad. Chicken salad and crispy toast. That&#x2019;s all I ever eat at Denny&#x2019;s.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;So why do you even bother looking at the menu?&#x201d;<br><br>He pulls at the wrinkles in the corner of one eye with his pinky finger. &#x201c;Just think about it. Wouldn&#x2019;t it be too sad to walk into Denny&#x2019;s and order chicken salad without looking at the menu? It&#x2019;s like telling the world, &#x2018;I come to Denny&#x2019;s all the time because I love the chicken salad.&#x2019; So I always go through the motion of opening the menu and pretending I picked the chicken salad after considering other things.&#x201d;<br><br>The waitress brings him water and he orders chicken salad and crispy toast. &#x201c;Make it really crispy,&#x201d; he says with conviction. &#x201c;Almost burnt.&#x201d; He also orders coffee for afterwards. The waitress inputs his order using a hand-held device and confirms it by reading it aloud.<br><br>&#x201c;And I think the young lady needs a refill,&#x201d; he says, pointing at Mari&#x2019;s cup.<br><br>&#x201c;Thank you, sir. I will bring the coffee right away.&#x201d;<br><br>He watches her go off.<br><br>&#x201c;You don&#x2019;t like chicken?&#x201d; he asks.<br><br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s not that,&#x201d; Mari says. &#x201c;But I make a point of not eating chicken out.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Why not?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Especially the chicken they serve in chain restaurants&#x2014; they&#x2019;re full of weird drugs. Growth hormones and stuff. The chickens are locked in these dark, narrow cages, and given all these shots, and their feed is full of chemicals, and they&#x2019;re put on conveyor belts, and machines cut their heads off and pluck them . . .&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Whoa!&#x201d; he says with a smile. The wrinkles at the corners of his eyes deepen. &#x201c;Chicken salad � la George Orwell!&#x201d;<br><br>Mari narrows her eyes and looks at him. She can&#x2019;t tell if he is making fun of her.<br><br>&#x201c;Anyhow,&#x201d; he says, &#x201c;the chicken salad here is not bad. Really.&#x201d;<br><br>As if suddenly recalling that he is wearing it, he takes off his leather coat, folds it, and lays it on the seat next to his. Then he rubs his hands together atop the table. He has on a green, coarse-knit crew-neck sweater. Like his hair, the wool of the sweater is tangled in places. He is obviously not the sort who pays a lot of attention to his appearance.<br><br>&#x201c;We met at a hotel swimming pool in Shinagawa. Two summers ago. Remember?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Sort of.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;My buddy was there, your sister was there, you were there, and I was there. Four of us all together. We had just entered college, and I&#x2019;m pretty sure you were in your second year of high school. Right?&#x201d;<br><br>Mari nods without much apparent interest.<br><br>&#x201c;My friend was kinda dating your sister then. He brought me along on like a double date. He dug up four free tickets to the pool, and your sister brought you along. You hardly said a word, though. You spent the whole time in the pool, swimming like a young dolphin. We went to the hotel tea room for ice cream afterwards. You ordered a peach melba.&#x201d;<br><br>Mari frowns. &#x201c;How come you remember stuff like that?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I never dated a girl who ate peach melba before. And you were cute, of course.&#x201d;<br><br>Mari looks at him blankly. &#x201c;Liar. You were staring at my sister the whole time.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I was?&#x201d;<br><br>Mari answers with silence.<br><br>&#x201c;Maybe I was,&#x201d; he says. &#x201c;For some reason I remember her bikini was really tiny.&#x201d;<br><br>Mari pulls out a cigarette, puts it between her lips, and lights it with her lighter.<br><br>&#x201c;Let me tell you something,&#x201d; he says. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m not trying to defend Denny&#x2019;s or anything, but I&#x2019;m pretty sure that smoking a whole pack of cigarettes is <i>way</i> worse for you than eating a plate of chicken salad that <i>might</i> have some problems with it. Don&#x2019;t you think so?&#x201d;<br><br>Mari ignores his question.<br><br>&#x201c;Another girl was supposed to go with my sister that time, but she got sick at the last minute and my sister forced me to go with her. To keep the numbers right.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;So you were in a bad mood.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I remember you, though.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Really?&#x201d;<br><br>Mari puts her finger on her right cheek.<br><br>The young man touches the deep scar on his own cheek. &#x201c;Oh, this. When I was a kid, I was going too fast on my bike and couldn&#x2019;t make the turn at the bottom of the hill. Another inch and I would have lost my right eye. My earlobe&#x2019;s deformed, too. Wanna see it?&#x201d;<br><br>Mari frowns and shakes her head.<br><br>The waitress brings the chicken salad and toast to the table. She pours fresh coffee into Mari&#x2019;s cup and checks to make sure she has brought all the ordered items to the table. He picks up his knife and fork and, with practiced movements, begins eating his chicken salad. Then he picks up a piece of toast, stares at it, and wrinkles his brow.<br><br>&#x201c;No matter how much I scream at them to make my toast as crispy as possible, I have never once gotten it the way I want it. I can&#x2019;t imagine why. What with Japanese industriousness and high-tech culture and the market principles that the Denny&#x2019;s chain is always pursuing, it shouldn&#x2019;t be that hard to get crispy toast, don&#x2019;t you think? So, why can&#x2019;t they do it? Of what value is a civilization that can&#x2019;t toast a piece of bread as ordered?&#x201d;<br><br>Mari doesn&#x2019;t take him up on this.<br><br>&#x201c;But anyhow, your sister was a real beauty,&#x201d; the young man says, as if talking to himself.<br><br>Mari looks up. &#x201c;Why do you say that in the past tense?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Why do I . . . ? I mean, I&#x2019;m talking about something that happened a long time ago, so I used the past tense, that&#x2019;s all. I&#x2019;m not saying she isn&#x2019;t a beauty now or anything.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;She&#x2019;s still pretty, I think.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Well, that&#x2019;s just dandy. But, to tell you the truth, I don&#x2019;t know Eri Asai all that well. We were in the same class for a year in high school, but I hardly said two words to her. It might be more accurate to say she wouldn&#x2019;t give me the time of day.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re still interested in her, right?&#x201d;<br><br>The young man stops his knife and fork in midair and thinks for a moment. &#x201c;Interested. Hmm. Maybe as a kind of intellectual curiosity.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Intellectual curiosity?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yeah, like, what would it feel like to go out on a date with a beautiful girl like Eri Asai? I mean, she&#x2019;s an absolute cover girl.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You call that <i>intellectual</i> curiosity?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Kind of, yeah.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;But back then, your friend was the one going out with her, and you were the other guy on a double date.&#x201d;<br><br>He nods with a mouthful of food, which he then takes all the time he needs to chew.<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m kind of a low-key guy. The spotlight doesn&#x2019;t suit me. I&#x2019;m more of a side dish&#x2014;cole slaw or French fries or a Wham! backup singer.&#x201d;</p><h2>Woody, Cisco, and Me: Seamen Three in the Merchant Marine (Music in American Life)</h2><p>Attorney and playwright Longhi recalls his three voyages as a merchant marine during World War II in the company of folk music legends Woody Guthrie and Cisco Houston. Despite some occasionally stilted dialog, Longhi&#39;s fast-paced memoir reads like a novel as the &#34;seamen three&#34; survive rough storms, crooked gamblers, and two torpedo attacks. Of the vivid cast of characters, the irrepressible Guthrie is the most compelling, though he sometimes drifts to the background as Longhi relates his own often hilarious exploits as ship&#39;s baker and chairman of the crew&#39;s union. (For a solid Guthrie biography, see Joe Klein&#39;s Woody Guthrie, LJ 10/15/80, still available in paperback.) Still, Guthrie&#39;s folksy persona looms above all others. With Guthrie and Houston long since dead, it is left to Longhi to tell stories that have only been hinted at in previous Guthrie biographies. Highly recommended.?Lloyd Jansen, Stockton- San Joaquin Cty. P.L</p><p>Woody, Cisco, &amp; Me is a "must read" romp that gives the reader rare insight into World War II experiences in the merchant marine with Woody Guthrie, his folk-singing friend Cisco Houston, and Jim Longhi, who was shamed by Woody and Cisco into joining with them. Brilliantly told - with pathos and salty humor - it is an irresistible story of bravery and hardship, sacrifice and boredom, and life and death, appealing not only to folk music fans but to those interested in tales of World War II adventures as well.Attorney and reluctant sailor Longhi relates the World War II experiences of a couple of his shipmates, folksingers Woody Guthrie and Cisco Houston. Committed champions of the underdog and social justice, Woody and Cisco wanted to fight fascism, but the army would take neither--Cisco because of poor eyesight and Woody for a panoply of reasons. The merchant marine, however, badly needed to man its "hastily welded ships . . . fighting their way across the North Atlantic" to supply the Allied war effort. Like many others, Longhi had a fussin' and fightin' time of it with Woody, whose ability to attract trouble and create bizarre situations ensured Cisco and Longhi rousing adventure in spite of the boredom of shipboard routine. Somewhat lacking in the womanizing and hard drinking one has come to expect in any Guthrie bio, complete or episodic, Longhi's chronicle of Woody's service years is far more fleshed out than any previous accounts of the period and very enjoyable. <i>Mike Tribby</i></p><h2>The Maritime History Of Massachusetts, 1783-1860 (Northeastern Classics Edition)</h2><p>Traces the growth of port cities, commerce with the Indies and China, and shipping, whaling, fishing, and shipbuilding enterprises in the eastern seaboard state</p><p>Samuel Eliot Morison was Professor of History at Harvard University.

It yields an extraordinary account of the rise and fall of Purgatory as both a belief and a lucrative institution--as well as a capacious new reading of the power of Hamlet.</p><p>In the mid-sixteenth century, English authorities abruptly changed the relationship between the living and dead. Declaring that Purgatory was a false "poem," they abolished the institutions and banned the practices that Christians relied on to ease the passage to Heaven for themselves and their dead loved ones. Greenblatt explores the fantastic adventure narratives, ghost stories, pilgrimages, and imagery by which a belief in a grisly "prison house of souls" had been shaped and reinforced in the Middle Ages. He probes the psychological benefits as well as the high costs of this belief and of its demolition.</p><p>With the doctrine of Purgatory and the elaborate practices that grew up around it, the church had provided a powerful method of negotiating with the dead. The Protestant attack on Purgatory destroyed this method for most people in England, but it did not eradicate the longings and fears that Catholic doctrine had for centuries focused and exploited. In his strikingly original interpretation, Greenblatt argues that the human desires to commune with, assist, and be rid of the dead were transformed by Shakespeare--consummate conjurer that he was--into the substance of several of his plays, above all the weirdly powerful Hamlet. Thus, the space of Purgatory became the stage haunted by literature's most famous ghost.</p><p>This book constitutes an extraordinary feat that could have been accomplished by only Stephen Greenblatt. It is at once a deeply satisfying reading of medieval religion, an innovative interpretation of the apparitions that trouble Shakespeare's tragic heroes, and an exploration of how a culture can be inhabited by its own spectral leftovers.</p></p><p><p>"Beyond its brilliant illumination of <i>Hamlet</i>, Stephen Greenblatt's book uses historical evidence to probe the nature of human memory--by nature insistent, contradictory, in every sense haunted--as it copes with the stark, yet mysterious reality of death. With a rare combination of learning, imagination and grace Greenblatt has created an exciting work of scholarship, alert to the ways a great work of art can both resemble and transform other modes of discourse and perception."<b>--Robert Pinsky</b></p><p>"<i>Hamlet in Purgatory</i> is a virtuoso exercise in untangling the interwoven threads of feeling and belief in early-seventeenth-century England . . . In this bold and brilliant book, Greenblatt demonstrates utterly compellingly why Hamlet can still hold our spiritual attention today."<b>--Lisa Jardine</b></p><p>"My understanding of the traditions concerning <i>Purgatory</i>, both learned and popular, has been gratifyingly deepened by the rich detail of Greenblatt's study. . . . The nature of the ghost of Hamlet's father is an old scholarly puzzle, but Greenblatt's book raises the discussion to a new level, and does so without dogmatism, rather with a subtle acceptance of the ambiguities inherent not only in the Ghost but in the great play as a whole. The book will be welcomed by all who care about the subject, and for the insights already known to abound in this scholar's work."<b>--Frank Kermode</b></p><p>"Stephen Greenblatt is a famously beguiling writer. That power of enchantment does not fail him here. His skill as a storyteller is constantly on display. But so too is his no less renowned skill as a skeptically demystifying cultural critic. The result is a book whose remarkable energy derives, as does that of Hamlet itself, from the mutually contradictory impulses it so tellingly expresses."<b>--Richard Helgerson, University of California, Santa Barbara</b></p><p>"This book is a brilliant essay on memory. Although it serves as a learned history of the idea of Purgatory and a subtle reading of Hamlet, it is primarily a book about how a culture faces loss, one that is gracefully, even movingly, written and one which reveals, as always, Greenblatt to be an unusually sensitive critic and thinker."<b>--David Scott Kastan, Columbia University</b></p><p>"A brilliant treatment of the history of Purgatory in England and its survivals and echoes throughout Shakespeare's plays, above all Hamlet."<b>--Carol Zaleski,<i>First Things</i></b></p><b>Stephen Greenblatt</b> is Cogan University Professor at Harvard University, where he teaches English and chairs the Concentration in History and Literature.

That's when she began telling me about The Good </em><em>Daughter. It became a taunt, a warning, an omen.<br><br></em>Jasmin Darznik came to America from Iran when she was only three years old, and she grew up knowing very little about her family's history. When she was in her early twenties, on a day shortly following her father's death, Jasmin was helping her mother move; a photograph fell from a stack of old letters. The girl pictured was her mother. She was wearing a wedding veil, and at her side stood a man whom Jasmin had never seen before.<br><br>At first, Jasmin's mother, Lili, refused to speak about the photograph, and Jasmin returned to her own home frustrated and confused. But a few months later, she received from her mother the first of ten cassette tapes that would bring to light the wrenching hidden story of her family's true origins in Iran: Lili's marriage at thirteen, her troubled history of abuse and neglect, and a daughter she was forced to abandon in order to escape that life. The final tape revealed that Jasmin's sister, Sara - The Good Daughter - was still living in Iran.<br><br>In this sweeping, poignant, and beautifully written memoir, Jasmin weaves the stories of three generations of Iranian women into a unique tale of one family's struggle for freedom and understanding. The result is an enchanting and unforgettable story of secrets, betrayal, and the unbreakable mother-daughter bond.</p><p>Born in Tehran to an Iranian mother and European father, Jasmin Darznik has contributed to the New York Times, Washington Post, Los Angeles Times, San Francisco Chronicle, and other publications. She received her doctorate in English from Princeton University and is a professor at Washington and Lee University.Raised in California, Darznik never imagined that her mother Lili lived another life completely in Iran before marrying Darznik&#x2019;s German father. Lili was married off at 14 to Kazem, a man who would prove to be violent and abusive. Lili gave birth to a daughter, Sara, but when Kazem&#x2019;s abuse escalated, Lili knew she had no choice but to flee his house and seek a divorce. The move cost her Sara, as Iranian law dictates children stay with their fathers. Lili decided to go to school in Germany to become a midwife, but the sudden death of her father forced her to come back to Iran to earn money for her own and her brother&#x2019;s schooling. When she returned to Germany, she drew the attention of the earnest German engineer who became her husband and the father of her second daughter, Darznik. Taken from tapes her mother sent her after Darznik discovered a photograph from her mother&#x2019;s first wedding, Darznik&#x2019;s memoir is a beautifully recounted homage to her mother&#x2019;s life and struggles. --Kristine Huntley</p><h2>Lorenza&#39;s Pasta: 200 Recipes for Family and Friends</h2><p>The highly acclaimed author of Italy the Beautiful and The Villa Table--who&#39;s also host of the highly successful PBS cooking series The de&#39;Medici Kitchen--now presents what is certain to become the essential pasta cookbook.

In his latest travelogue Michael Palin crosses the borders of lands that until 15 years ago were hidden behind the Iron Curtain. One can hear his delight in digging up truffles, discovering Bulgarian Gypsies, and watching wrestling Turks. Appropriately, Palin finds a more somber tone for the aching weight of visiting Balkan mine fields, the concentration camp of Auschwitz, and the city of Dresden. �Overwhelmed by significance,� he comments. Overall, he sees a cautiously optimistic future for the New Europe. As always, Palin escorts us armchair travelers down many a less-traveled road.

He visited dozens of these communities &#x2014; virtually every one in existence &#x2014; and read extensively in their doctrinal and other literature in preparation for this book. His straightforward, factual report on what he saw and learned is still a vital document for students of American history, sociology, and culture.<br>The Amana Society, the Harmonists at Economy, the Separatists of Zoar, the Shakers, the Oneida and Wallingford Perfectionists, the Aurora and Bethel communes, the Icarians, the Bishop Hill colony, the Cedar Vale commune, the Social Freedom Community, and three non-communistic colonies (Anaheim, California; Vineland, New Jersey; and Silkville Prairie Home, Kansas) are all examined in detail. They emerge from these pages as living experiments in human relations.<br>For each community, Nordhoff discusses history, religious or other guiding philosophy, social habits, and customs, and business and administration. He also supplies vignettes of his visits and interviews, vividly describing the houses and other buildings, the physical settings, the clothing, food, everyday conversation, intellectual and aesthetic aspiration, etc. within each society.<br>With its concluding chapter on conditions requisite to the success of a communistic society and on the effects of such a society upon its members, and its 38 illustrations of interiors and exteriors, typical clothing styles, and so on, Nordhoff's work is a refreshingly unprejudiced report on socialism and communism in their prescientific infancy. It is especially welcome at a time of growing interest in America's social and cultural past.</p><p></p><h2>Proclaiming the Gospel: First-Century Performance of Mark</h2><p>Scholars have long understood that the texts we now know as the Gospels were read aloud in the Greco-Roman world, but few have actually envisioned what a performance of the Gospel of Mark would have been like in the first century and how it would have shaped the experience of its audience. Proclaiming the Gospel shows us. Oral performances in the New Testament world were lively affairs. In the performance of Greco-Roman theater, readers lose their voices from the stress of emotional passages. Audiences cheer for philosophers as if at a rock concert, and in law courts, they are paid for their responses. Storytellers compete for attention with jugglers, and some speakers must fend off hostile crowds. Congregations at churches and synagogues cheer as if at the theater. Shiner reveals the ways that Mark wrote his Gospel to compete in this arena and how his audiences would have responded: applause for the miracles of Jesus, then an altogether different response at the cross. Whitney Shiner is Assistant Professor of Christian Origins at George Mason University, Fairfax, Virginia, and the author of Follow Me: Disciples in markan Rhetoric.</p><p>Whitney Shiner is Assistant Professor of Christian Origins at George Mason University, Fairfax, Virginia."Proclaiming the Gospel represents a breakthrough in the emerging discipline of Performance Criticism. By drawing on evidence from a wide variety of ancient sources and correlating it with clues from the Gospel, Whitney Shiner constructs a plausible scenario for performances of Mark in antiquity. In so doing, he enlivens the sights and sounds of the Gospel and sheds considerable light on its meaning and power. Accessible to the general reader, this book should be of special interest to scholars, students, and preachers."&#x2014;David Rhoads, Lutheran School of Theilogy at Chicago (David Rhoads)<br><br>"Having been part of the intrigued audience at professional presentations of Whitney Shiner on the oral presentation of the Gospel of Mark in the first century, I am delighted that a written version of his oral work on orality is now available to me, my students, and my colleagues&#x2014;in biblical studies and in the humanities more broadly.

This fine book goes a long way to giving the answer.

He treats the text of Mark as sheet music that needs to be played to be properly comprehended. Because he takes seriously the notion that the Gospel of Mark grew out of and preserves oral performance tradition, Shiner includes discoveries about Mark that grow out of his own performing of scenes from the story. This book will be useful to any biblical interpreter, especially pastors and teachers. In addition, it would be a good resource to use in an undergraduate or seminary classroom.

In this book, she conveys not only knowledge but affection. She covers 30 of the most common wild plants of North America, their habitat, history, and practical value.</p><p>At last, a book that justifies not spending endless days trying to eradicate the usually unwanted, nearly always useless plants called weeds. Many of Jones's ( How Does Your Garden Grow ) weeds are in fact considered wildflowers (yarrow, Queen Anne's laceWeb ) or herbs (purslane, watercress), and in her view they're quite all right. Partly due to Jones's obvious delight in rescuing unheralded orphans of nature, they gradually win our respect as we read about the many uses, historical and modern, of the plants. Ground ivy, for example, was employed by the Saxons in clarifying beer before hops were known; the juice of its leaves, high in vitamin C, was prized in treating scurvy. The various virtues Jones extols may not convince all gardeners to actually cultivate weeds, but may induce a less deadly fanaticism in pulling them. As well as providing detailed descriptions of each weed, the author includes a helpful appendix of folk remedies (for acne, freckles, warts) and an exhaustive list of common names. <br>Copyright 1991 Reed Business Information, Inc.Jones, author of How Does Your Garden Grow? ( LJ 3/1/89), hopes to so impress readers with the value of common weeds (for purifying the blood, treating the bite of a mad dog, and the like) that the very term "weed" will eventually be "abolished altogether for being one of the most intolerant, negative words." To this end, she profiles 30 favorite plants such as burdock, poison ivy, and pokeweed, emphasizing their use in herbal folklore and cooking. Jones, therefore, does not duplicate Sara Stein's My Weeds ( LJ 6/15/88), which used common plants to illustrate botanical principles. However, it's hard to imagine that anyone prepared to drink couch-grass tea hasn't already found inspiration in one of the many herbalism books on library shelves. Gardeners will view most of these plants with "intolerance" no matter what Jones says. Buy where demand warrants.<br><i>- Beth Clewis, J. Sargeant Reynolds Community Coll.

She has written two other cookbooks, The Peach Tree Family Cookbook (now in its 3rd printing), and her latest, With Love, from Cynthia (printed Dec. 1999). Her loyal following, and the strong reception she has received from all three cookbooks, reflects the intensely personal relationship she has developed with her readers. Because Cynthia is so prolific in developing recipes for the restaurant, a new collection is generally published about every four years. Cynthia&#39;s recipes have won acclaim from Gourmet Magazine, American Country Cooking Cookbook, Dallas Morning News, and San Antonio Express-News.

Sure, <i>The Complete Illustrated Guide to Tarot</i> includes some of the most popular spreads for divination, such as the "Celtic cross," but the full-color photographs also offer a rare opportunity to see some of the earliest cards, such as the Visconti-Sforza Tarot of the 15th century.

This book analyzes for the first time the totality of the Associates&#39; achievement.This is first-rate business history, combining the stories of the pioneer entrepreneurs of the Massachusetts textile industry and their self-conscious effort to solidify the place of the upper class in a democracy. Francis C. Lowell, Nathan Appleton, and others formed a group of "Boston Associates" that first erected mills at Waltham and then in the 1820s at the planned community of Lowell. Dalzell takes pains to stress that these men were risk-averse entrepreneurs; they fled the shipping business for the safer business of manufacturing. Dalzell offers as well a fine history of how the Associates invested in ancillary fields, e.g., insurance, and how they invented the model of philanthropy as the justification for unequal wealth.

Fitzpatrick goes on an allegorical search for his father&#39;s ghost, revisiting his stories, and figuring out how we become who we are. This is a lyrical story of the burial of a salesman, of the man&#39;s juvenile delinquent son, of driving aimlessly around the city when the son was excused from school. It&#39;s about how, when we lose our parents or those who came before us, we can honor their history, add to it, and, if we&#39;re smart, nurture it. The book features forty beautifully printed etchings by the author, a major American artist whose works have been shown throughout the country and the world. Tony Fitzpatrick&#39;s etchings, prints, paintings and drawings are collected in museums worldwide including the Art Institute of Chicago, the Museum of Contemporary Art in Chicago), the Museum of Modern Art in New York, and the National Museum of American Art in Washington D.C..Tony Fitzpatrick was born in Chicago in 1958. He is a former boxer, talk radio host, actor and a founding participant in Chicago&#39;s world-famous poetry slam scene. He received a Jeff Award for best actor in the play Mass Murder, and has appeared in major movies including Philadelphia and Married to the Mob. Today, he is a thriving writer and visual artist.

Now, in this scathingly funny and politically incorrect self-help book, Mr. Lapham offers his best advice to aspiring careerists seeking to ride in helicopters and see themselves on television.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>Drawing upon a lifetime of experience among the cogno-scenti, Mr. Lapham breaks rank and reveals the unspoken secrets of getting ahead: what to say, how to dress, when to lie, whom to befriend, where to be seen, and why it is absolutely essential to wear clean shoes. ("The first impression is also the last impression. You don't wish to be remembered as the stain on the rug.")<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>Anyone interested in self-advancement will be transformed by <b>Lapham's Rules of Influence</b>, which offers proven nuggets of wisdom. For example, when trying to impress the boss, remember: "Flattery cannot be too often or too recklessly applied. Think of it as suntan lotion or moisturizing cream."<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>Written with stinging wit and tongue planted firmly in cheek, <b>Lapham's Rules of Influence</b> is a brilliant critique of class and manners in America, packed with the kind of irreverent observation that only Lewis Lapham can provide.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;Seek out the acquaintance of people richer and more important than yourself, and never take an interest in people who cannot do you any favors.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;Rumor tinged with malice is the most precious form of gossip. When you are invited to spend a weekend with important journalists or movie stars, it is considered polite to bring four items of unpublished slander in lieu of a house present or a bottle of wine.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;Make unsparing use of clich�s. The empty word is the correct word. Contrary to the opinion of snobbish New York intellectuals, the placid murmur of clich� is always preferable to the expression of strong feeling, which is an embarrassment.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;A truly fashionable dinner party ends at the moment when all the guests have arrived and everybody has been seen or not seen. Once attendance has been taken, the rest of the evening is superfluous.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;A good meeting is one at which nothing happens. Sit erect, second all the motions, remember everybody's name.</p><p>Want to get ahead in the world? To be a player, rather than a ticket holder? A mover and a shaker, rather than the moved or shaken? Lewis Lapham has a formula: Suck up, then suck up some more, and when you're finished with that, try to arrange a dinner with more people you can suck up to. Lapham, the iconoclastic editor of <i>Harper's Magazine</i>, argues that brownnosing has a long tradition in America, and quotes no less a source than Alexis de Tocqueville, who in 1831 was shocked to find that the "courtier spirit" was alive and well in the rough-and-tumble American democracy.<p> The advice you'll find in <i>Rules of Influence</i> drips with acid, which you'd expect if you read any of Lapham's columns in <i>Harper's</i>, for which he won a National Magazine Award in 1995. But even in the sarcasm, one can find surprisingly practical advice. For example, he notes that "[t]oo much curiosity is a mark of inferior rank. You will be mistaken for a tourist or a waiter" if you ask too many questions. He also notes that the limelight is "[n]ot a safe place.... Too steep an ascent into the atmospheres of fame invites a correspondingly steep descent into the base camp of anonymity." If only Elizabeth Berkley could have read this book before she did <i>Showgirls</i>! <i>--Lou Schuler</i></p><b>Lewis Lapham</b> was born in 1935 in San Francisco and educated at the Hotchkiss School, Yale University, and Cambridge University. He is the author of several books of essays, including <i>The Wish for Kings, Money and Class in America, Fortune's Child, Imperial Masquerade, Hotel America</i>, and <i>Waiting for the Barbarians</i>. He has been a reporter for the San Francisco Examiner and for the <i>New York Herald Tribune</i>, a syndicated newspaper columnist, and, since 1983, editor of <i>Harper's Magazine</i>, where his monthly essays won a 1995 National Magazine Award for their "exhilarating point of view in an age of conformity." Between 1989 and 1991, he was the host and executive editor of Bookmark, a weekly national public-television series. He was also the host and author of a six-part documentary series, American Century, broadcast on public television in 1989. He lives in New York City with his wife and three children.</p><h2>Gain</h2><p><b>A <i>New York Times</i> Notable Book of the Year</b><br><br><i>Gain</i> tells two parallel stories: one, of Laura Bodey, divorced mother of two and successful real-estate agent in the small town of Lacewood, Illinois, who one day discovers that she has ovarian cancer; and two, of Clare Soap &amp; Chemical, the company begun by three merchant brothers in 19th-century Boston, which by the turn of the century has grown into a large multiconglomerate with factories in Laura's hometown. As the history of Clare Soap changes through the history of America, so a modern-day Laura Bodey descends into a battle with her terminal illness. By the novel's conclusion, we have learned how the largest enterprises affect us on the most personal level.</p><p>Richard Powers made his debut in 1985 with <i>Three Farmers on Their Way to a Dance</i>, a brilliant and almost unbelievably brainy meditation on what he calls "our tortured century." Since then he has produced four more novels, showcasing his mastery of genetics, art history, computer science, theology, aesthetics, and a host of other pointy-headed fields. The author's range--and the meticulous music of his prose, which suggests a considerably less zany Thomas Pynchon--is mind-boggling. Yet his subject remains fairly constant: the acceleration, and consequent dehumanization, of contemporary life.<p> In <i>Gain</i>, Powers puts our modernity through the wringer once again. This time, though, he points the finger at one villain in particular: rampant, American-style capitalism, as exemplified by a conglomerate called Clare International. His novel, it should be said, is no piece of agitprop, but an intricate lamination of two separate stories. On one hand, Powers describes the rise (and fall and rise) of the Clare empire, beginning in its mercantile infancy: "That family flocked to commerce like finches to morning. They clung to the watery edge of existence: ports, always ports. They thrived in tidal pools, half salt, half sweet." The author's Clare-eyed narrative amounts to a pocket history of corporate America, and a marvelously entertaining one. Lest we get too enamored of this success story, though, Powers introduces a second, countervailing tale, in which a 42-year-old resident of Lacewood, Illinois, is stricken with ovarian cancer. Lacewood happens to be the headquarters of Clare's North American Agricultural Products Division, and lo and behold, it seems that chemical wastes from the plant may be the source of Laura Bodey's illness. The analogy between corporate and cancerous proliferation is pointed--too pointed, perhaps. But no other recent novelist has written so knowingly, and with such splendid indignation, about capitalism <i>and</i> its discontents.</p>"Erudite, penetrating and splendidly written...There is no gainsaying the remarkable artistry and authority with which Powers, in this dazzling book, continues to impart his singular vision of our life and times." --Bruce Bawer, <i>The New York Times Book Review</i><p> "Powers is a writer of blistering intellect; he has only to think about a subject and the paint curls off. He is a novelist of ideas and a novelist of witness, and in both respects he has few American peers." --Richard Eder, <i>Los Angeles Times Book Review</i></p><p> "Richard Powers' powerful and peculiar novel, <i>Gain</i>, is the largest compliment any author has paid to the American reading public in decades." --Thomas M. Disch, <i>Washington Post Book World</i></p><p> "<i>Gain</i> consists equally of horizon-busting breadth of knowledge and excruciating depth of vulnerability...Powers hovers impossibly between extremes with a tightrope walker's perfect balance. He may be at once the smartest and the most warm-hearted novelist in America today." --Melvin Jules Bukiet, <i>The Chicago Tribune</i></p><p> "Richard Powers has proven himself a visionary writer...Throughout <i>Gain</i> there are dreamy, uncannily accurate little paragraphs on the Promethean messianism of corporate America." --Greil Marcus, <i>The San Francisco Examiner &amp; Chronicle</i></p><p> "Subtle, provocative, and powerful...Richard Powers' deceptively simple and terrifyingly effective novel <i>Gain</i> says it better than anyone has in a long time: buyer beware." --Rick Moody, <i>Voice Literary Supplement</i></p></p><h2>Streams of Silver: The Icewind Dale Trilogy, Part 2 (Forgotten Realms: The Legend of Drizzt, Book V)</h2><p><b>The fifth in a series of premiere hardcover editions of Salvatore&#x2019;s classic dark elf tales.<br><br></b>This new release of the classic R.A.

Here is a book as fresh as tomorrow's headlines, and as entertaining as its predecessors.</p><p>If you've ever had the sneaking (and perhaps depressing) suspicion that the Internet is radically changing the world as you know it, buck up. No wait, buckle up--it is. While some people celebrate this and others bemoan it, Michael Lewis has been busy investigating the reasons for this rapid change. Employing the sarcastic wit and keen recognition of social shifts that readers of <i>Liar's Poker</i> and <i>The New New Thing</i> will recognize, Lewis takes us on a quick spin through today and speculates on what it might mean for tomorrow.<p> Central to Lewis's observations is the idea that the Internet hasn't really caused anything; rather it fills a type of social hole, the most obvious of which is a need to alter relations between "insiders" and "outsiders." In <i>Next</i>, Lewis shows how the Internet is the ideal model for sociologists who believe that our "selves are merely the masks we wear in response to the social situations in which we find ourselves." It is the place where a New Jersey boy barely into his teens flouts the investment system, making big enough bucks to get the SEC breathing down his neck for stock market fraud. Where Markus, a bored adolescent stuck in a dusty desert town and too young to even drive, becomes the most-requested legal expert on Askme.com, doling out advice on everything from how to plead to murder charges to how much an Illinois resident can profit from illegal gains before being charged with fraud ($5,001 was the figure Markus supplied to this particular cost-benefit query). Where a left-leaning kid of 14 in a depressed town outside Manchester is too poor to take up a partial scholarship to a school for gifted children, but who spends all hours (all cheap call-time hours, at least) engaged in "digital socialism," trying to develop a successor to Gnutella, the notorious file-sharing program that had spawned the new field of peer-to-peer computing. Lewis burrows deeply into each of these stories and others, examining social phenomena that the Internet has contributed to: the redistribution of prestige and authority and the reversal of the social order; the erosive effect on the money culture (both in the democratization of capital and in the effect of gambling losing its "status as a sin"); the decreased value we place on formal training (or as he puts it "casual thought went well with casual dress"); and the increased need for knowledge exchange.</p><p> Lewis's observations are piercingly sharp. He can be very funny in portraying ordinary people's behavior, but remains thorough and insightful in his examination of the social consequences. He notes that Jonathan Lebed, the teenage online investor, had "glimpsed the essential truth of the market--that even people who called themselves professionals were often incapable of independent thought and that most people, though obsessed with money, had little ability to make decisions about it." While Lewis's commentary gets a little more dense and theoretical toward the end, <i>Next</i> is an entertaining, thought-provoking look at life in an Internet-driven world. --<i>S.

When she is found dead in her bathtub, a handwritten suicide note left on her bed, her parents insist that their daughter would never take her own life.</p><p>But Julia's enviable world was more complicated than it seemed. The pressure to excel at Casden was enormous. Abuse of prescription antidepressants and ADHD medication ran rampant among students; an unlabeled bottle of pills in Julia's purse suggests she had succumbed to the trend. And a search of Julia's computer reveals that in the days leading up to her death she was engaged in a dangerous game of cyberbullying against an unlikely victim.</p><p>NYPD detective Ellie Hatcher is convinced the case is a suicide, but she knows from personal experience that a loving family can be the last to accept the truth. When the Whitmires use their power to force a criminal investigation, Ellie's resistance causes trouble for her both at work and in her personal life. As she is pressured to pursue a case she doesn't believe in, she is pulled into Julia's inner circle&#x2014;an eclectic mix of overly precocious teenagers from Manhattan's most privileged families as well as street kids from Greenwich Village.

Fifteen years have gone by since those glory days, and Neely has come home to Messina to bury Coach Eddie Rake, the man who molded the Spartans into an unbeatable football dynasty.<br><br>Now, as Coach Rake&#x2019;s &#x201c;boys&#x201d; sit in the bleachers waiting for the dimming field lights to signal his passing, they replay the old games, relive the old glories, and try to decide once and for all whether they love Eddie Rake &#x2013; or hate him. For Neely Crenshaw, a man who must finally forgive his coach &#x2013;-- and himself &#x2013; before he can get on with his life, the stakes are especially high.</p><p>With <i>Bleachers</i> John Grisham departs again from the legal thriller to experiment with a character-driven tale of reunion, broken high school dreams, and missed chances. While the book falls short of the compelling storytelling that has made Grisham a bestselling author, it is nonetheless a diverting novella that succeeds as light fiction. <p> The story centers on the impending death of the Messina Spartans' football coach Eddie Rake. One of the most victorious coaches in high school football history, Rake is a man both loved and feared by his players and by a town that relishes his 13 state titles. The hero of the novel is Neely Crenshaw, a former Rake All-American whose NFL prospects ended abruptly after a cheap shot to the knees. Neely has returned home for the first time in years to join a nightly vigil for Rake at the Messina stadium. Having wandered through life with little focus since his college days, he struggles to reconcile his conflicted feelings towards his former coach, and he assays to rekindle love in the ex-girlfriend he abandoned long ago. For Messina and for Neely, the homecoming offers the prospect of building a life after Rake. </p><p> Physically a narrow book, <i>Bleachers</i> is a modest fiction in many respects. The emotional scope is akin to that of a short story, with a single-minded focus on explorations of nostalgia and regret. The dialogue, especially that of Neely's friend Paul Curry, is sometimes wooden as characters recall Messina history in paragraphs that were perhaps better left to the narrator. But Grisham has otherwise written a well-made, entertaining--if a bit sentimental--story. <i>--Patrick O'Kelley</i></p>JOHN GRISHAM played (at times) quarterback for the Chargers of Southaven High School, Southaven, Mississippi. He was not an All-American.</p><h2>Throat Sprockets: A Novel of Erotic Obsession</h2><p>Spending his lunch hours in a porno theater to relieve his boredom, a young advertising executive discovers an obscure film called <i>Throat Sprockets </i>and develops a fascination for women's throats that gradually consumes his life.</p><p>Consider the plight of the nameless narrator in this intriguing novel of dark obsession. A chance viewing of an "adult" film called Throat Sprockets transforms his notion of sexuality and, thereby, his identity. From then on his life revolves around this elusive film, his desire to see it again and his lust to share in the passions it records. The narrator's obsession (which may be guessed at from the book's title) is not one that the average reader is likely to share, but first novelist Lucas has more in mind here. The larger issue is the power of film, and it is explored amidst frequently striking images and turns of phrase. Though he is limited to words in describing what is primarily a visual experience, Lucas's implicit proposition-that a director could willfully manipulate his audience to a dire degree-is successfully and somewhat frighteningly supported by the unfolding drama of this novel. The narrator accuses: "What had been done to me [by the film] had been no accident. It had been nothing less than a conscious and deliberate act of terrorism"; and he is not the lone victim. Lucas allows parody to intrude when he depicts the spreading "sprocketing" subculture as the subject of an inflammatory talk show. Rare slips aside, Lucas has created a grippingly twisted tale of a mind and soul ensnared. <br>Copyright 1994 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Arts and Crafts Gardens</h2><p>This charming book, first published in 1912 as Gardens for Small Country Houses by Country Life at a time when both Jekyll and Weaver were writing for the magazine, contains the substance of a legend.

The real answer will probably surprise you. In our culture, which emphasizes group work from elementary school through the business world, everything seems geared toward extroverts. Luckily, introverts everywhere have a new spokesperson: Susan Cain, a self-proclaimed introvert who&#x2019;s taken it upon herself to better understand the place of introverts in culture and society. With <em>Quiet: The Power of Introverts in a World That Can&#x2019;t Stop Talking</em>, Cain explores introversion through psychological research old and new, personal experiences, and even brain chemistry, in an engaging and highly-readable fashion. By delving into introversion, Cain also seeks to find ways for introverts and extroverts to better understand one another--and for introverts to understand their own contradictions, such as the ability to act like extroverts in certain situations. Highly accessible and uplifting for any introvert--and any extrovert who knows an introvert (and over one-third of us are introverts)--<em>Quiet</em> has the potential to revolutionize the &#x201c;extrovert ideal.&#x201d;<em> &#x2013;Malissa Kent</em> <br> <br> <strong>Amazon Exclusive: Q &amp; A with Author Susan Cain</strong> <br> <br> <strong>Q: Why did you write the book?</strong><br> <strong> A:</strong> For the same reason that Betty Friedan published <em>The Feminine Mystique</em> in 1963. Introverts are to extroverts what women were to men at that time--second-class citizens with gigantic amounts of untapped talent. Our schools, workplaces, and religious institutions are designed for extroverts, and many introverts believe that there is something wrong with them and that they should try to &#x201c;pass&#x201d; as extroverts. The bias against introversion leads to a colossal waste of talent, energy, and, ultimately, happiness. <p><strong>Q: What personal significance does the subject have for you?</strong><br> <strong>A:</strong> When I was in my twenties, I started practicing corporate law on Wall Street. At first I thought I was taking on an enormous challenge, because in my mind, the successful lawyer was comfortable in the spotlight, whereas I was introverted and occasionally shy. But I soon realized that my nature had a lot of advantages: I was good at building loyal alliances, one-on-one, behind the scenes; I could close my door, concentrate, and get the work done well; and like many introverts, I tended to ask a lot of questions and listen intently to the answers, which is an invaluable tool in negotiation. I started to realize that there&#x2019;s a lot more going on here than the cultural stereotype of the introvert-as-unfortunate would have you believe. I had to know more, so I spent the past five years researching the powers of introversion.</p> <p><strong>Q: Was there ever a time when American society valued introverts more highly?</strong><br> <strong>A:</strong> In the nation&#x2019;s earlier years it was easier for introverts to earn respect. America once embodied what the cultural historian Warren Susman called a &#x201c;Culture of Character,&#x201d; which valued inner strength, integrity, and the good deeds you performed when no one was looking. You could cut an impressive figure by being quiet, reserved, and dignified. Abraham Lincoln was revered as a man who did not &#x201c;offend by superiority,&#x201d; as Emerson put it.</p> <p><strong>Q: You discuss how we can better embrace introverts in the workplace. Can you explain? </strong><br> <strong>A:</strong> Introverts thrive in environments that are not overstimulating&#x2014;surroundings in which they can think (deeply) before they speak. This has many implications. Here are two to consider: (1) Introverts perform best in quiet, private workspaces&#x2014;but unfortunately we&#x2019;re trending in precisely the opposite direction, toward open-plan offices. (2) If you want to get the best of all your employees&#x2019; brains, don&#x2019;t simply throw them into a meeting and assume you&#x2019;re hearing everyone&#x2019;s ideas. You&#x2019;re not; you&#x2019;re hearing from the most vocally assertive people. Ask people to put their ideas in writing before the meeting, and make sure you give everyone time to speak.</p> <p><strong>Q: <em>Quiet</em> offers some terrific insights for the parents of introverted children. What environment do introverted kids need in order to thrive, whether it&#x2019;s at home or at school? </strong><br> <strong>A:</strong> The best thing parents and teachers can do for introverted kids is to treasure them for who they are, and encourage their passions. This means: (1) Giving them the space they need. If they need to recharge alone in their room after school instead of plunging into extracurricular activities, that&#x2019;s okay. (2) Letting them master new skills at their own pace. If they&#x2019;re not learning to swim in group settings, for example, teach them privately. (3) Not calling them &#x201c;shy&#x201d;--they&#x2019;ll believe the label and experience their nervousness as a fixed trait rather than an emotion they can learn to control.</p> <p><strong>Q: What are the advantages to being an introvert?</strong><br> <strong>A:</strong> There are too many to list in this short space, but here are two seemingly contradictory qualities that benefit introverts: introverts like to be alone--and introverts enjoy being cooperative. Studies suggest that many of the most creative people are introverts, and this is partly because of their capacity for quiet. Introverts are careful, reflective thinkers who can tolerate the solitude that idea-generation requires. On the other hand, <em>implementing</em> good ideas requires cooperation, and introverts are more likely to prefer cooperative environments, while extroverts favor competitive ones.</p> <p></p> <p><b>A Reader&#x2019;s Guide for <i>Quiet:The Power of Introverts in a World that Can&#x2019;t Stop Talking</i></b></p> <p>By Susan Cain</p> <p><strong>Introduction</strong></p> <p>At least one-third of the people we know are introverts.

That was what the boy had promised us, the boy who never showed.<br><br> To be honest, I hadn&#x2019;t expected to find the chairlift. Not through the maze of old-growth firs and not in the dwindling light. Not without our escort. A minute earlier, I&#x2019;d been on the brink of suggesting that we give up and hike back to the logging road. But at the peak of our despondency we saw it: the lift, rising like a mirage out of the timber woods, its four dark cables striping the red sunset. Chairs were floating up the mountainside, forty feet above our heads. Empty chairs, upholstered in ice, swaying lightly in the wind. Sailing beside them, just as swiftly and serenely, a hundred chairs came down the mountain. As if a mirror were malfunctioning, each chair separating from a buckle-bright double. Nobody was manning the loading station; if we wanted to take the lift we&#x2019;d have to do it alone. I squeezed Clara&#x2019;s hand.<br><br> A party awaited us at the peak. Or so we&#x2019;d been told by Mr. No-Show, Mr. Nowhere, a French boy named Eugene de La Rochefoucauld.<br><br> &#x201c;I bet his real name is Burt,&#x201d; Clara said angrily. We had never been stood up before. &#x201c;I bet he&#x2019;s actually from Tennessee.&#x201d;<br><br> Well, he had certainly seemed European, when we met him coming down the mountain road on horseback, one week ago this night. He&#x2019;d had that hat! Such a convincingly stupid goatee! He&#x2019;d pronounced his name as if he were coughing up a jewel. Eugene de La Rochefoucauld had proffered a nasally invitation: would we be his guests next Saturday night, at the gala opening of the Evergreen Lodge? We&#x2019;d ride the new chairlift with him to the top of the mountain, and be among the first visitors to the marvellous new ski resort. The President himself might be in attendance.<br><br> Clara, unintimidated, had flirted back. &#x201c;Two dates&#x2014;is that not being a little greedy, Eugene?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;No less would be acceptable,&#x201d; he&#x2019;d said, smiling, &#x201c;for a man of my stature.&#x201d; (Eugene was five feet four; we&#x2019;d assumed he meant education, wealth.) The party was to be held seven thousand feet above Lucerne, Oregon, the mountain town where we had marooned ourselves, at nineteen and twenty-two; still pretty (Clara was beautiful), still young enough to attract notice, but penniless, living week to week in a &#x201c;historic&#x201d; boarding house. &#x201c;Historic&#x201d; had turned out to be the landlady&#x2019;s synonym for &#x201c;haunted.&#x201d; &#x201c;Turn-of-the-century sash windows,&#x201d; we&#x2019;d discovered, meant &#x201c;pneumonia holes.&#x201d;<br><br> We&#x2019;d waited for Eugene for close to an hour, while Time went slinking around the forest, slyly rearranging its shadows; now a red glow clung to the huge branches of the Douglas firs. When I finally spoke, the bony snap in my voice startled us both.<br><br> &#x201c;We don&#x2019;t need him, Clara.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;We don&#x2019;t?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;No. We can get there on our own.&#x201d;<br><br> Clara turned to me with blue lips and flakes daggering her lashes. I felt a pang: I could see both that she was afraid of my proposal and that she could be persuaded. This is a terrible knowledge to possess about a friend. Nervously, I counted my silver and gold bracelets, meting out reasons for making the journey. If we did not make the trip, I would have to pawn them. I argued that it was riskier&nbsp;<i>not</i>&nbsp;to take this risk. (For me, at least; Clara had her wealthy parents waiting back in Florida. As much as we dared together, we never risked our friendship by bringing up that gulf.) I touched the fake red flower pinned to my black bun. What had we gone to all this effort for? We owed our landlady twelve dollars for January&#x2019;s rent. Did Clara prefer to wait in the drifts for our prince, that fake frog, Eugene, to arrive?<br><br> For months, all anybody in Lucerne had been able to talk about was this lodge, the centerpiece of a new ski resort on Mt. Joy. Another New Deal miracle. In his Fireside Chats, Roosevelt had promised us that these construction projects would lift us out of the Depression. Sometimes I caught myself squinting hungrily at the peak, as if the government money might be visible, falling from the actual clouds. Out-of-work artisans had flocked to northern Oregon: carpenters, masons, weavers, engineers. The Evergreen Lodge, we&#x2019;d heard, had original stonework, carved from five thousand pounds of native granite. Its doors were cathedral huge, made of hand-cut ponderosa pine. Murals had been commissioned from local artists: scenes of mountain wildflowers, rearing bears. Quilts covered the beds, hand-crocheted by the New Deal men. I loved to picture their callused black thumbs on the bridally white muslin. Architecturally, what was said to stun every visitor was the main hall: a huge hexagonal chamber, with a band platform and &#x201c;acres for dancing, at the top of the world!&#x201d;<br><br> W.P.A. workers cut trails into the side of Mt. Joy, assisted by the Civilian Conservation Corps boys from Camp Thistle and Camp Bountiful. I&#x2019;d seen these young men around town, on leave from the woods, in their mud-caked boots and khaki shirts with the&nbsp;government logo. Their greasy faces clumped together like olives in a jar. They were the young mechanics who had wrenched the lift out of a snowy void and into skeletal, functioning existence. To raise bodies from the base of the mountain to the summit in eleven minutes! It sounded like one of Jules Verne&#x2019;s visions.<br><br> &#x201c;See that platform?&#x201d; I said to Clara. &#x201c;Stand there, and fall back into the next chair. I&#x2019;ll be right behind you.&#x201d;<br><br> At first, the climb was beautiful. An evergreen army held its position in the whipping winds. Soon, the woods were replaced by fields of white. Icy outcroppings rose like fangs out of a pink-rimmed sky. We rose, too, our voices swallowed by the cables&#x2019; groaning. Clara was singing something that I strained to hear, and failed to comprehend.<br> &nbsp;<br><br> ***<br> &nbsp;<br><br> Clara and I called ourselves the Prospectors. Our fathers, two very different kinds of gambler, had been obsessed with the Gold Rush, and we grew up hearing stories about Yukon fever and the Klondike stampeders. We knew the legend of the farmer who had panned out a hundred and thirty thousand dollars, the clerk who dug up eighty-five thousand, the blacksmith who discovered a haul of the magic metal on Rabbit Creek and made himself a hundred grand richer in a single hour. This period of American history held a special appeal for Clara&#x2019;s father, Mr. Finisterre, a bony-faced Portuguese immigrant to southwestern Florida who had wrung his modest fortune out of the sea-damp wallets of tourists. My own father had killed himself outside the dog track in the spring of 1931, and I&#x2019;d been fortunate to find a job as a maid at the Hotel Finisterre.<br><br> Clara Finisterre was the only other maid on staff&#x2014;a summer job. Her parents were strict and oblivious people. Their thousand rules went unenforced. They were very busy with their guests. A sea serpent, it was rumored, haunted the coastline beside the hotel, and ninety per cent of our tourism was serpent-driven. Amateur teratologists in Panama hats read the newspaper on the veranda, drinking orange juice and idly scanning the horizon for fins.<br><br> &#x201c;Thank you,&#x201d; Mr. Finisterre whispered to me once, too sozzled to remember my name, &#x201c;for keeping the secret that there is no secret.&#x201d; The black Atlantic rippled emptily in his eyeglasses.<br><br> Every night, Mrs. Finisterre hosted a cocktail hour: cubing green and orange melon, cranking songs out of the ivory gramophone, pouring bright malice into the fruit punch in the form of a mentally deranging Portuguese rum. She&#x2019;d apprenticed her three beautiful daughters in the Light Arts, the Party Arts. Clara was her eldest. Together, the Finisterre women smoothed arguments and linens. They concocted banter, gab, palaver, patter&#x2014;every sugary variety of small talk that dissolves into the night. I hated the cocktail hour, and, whenever I could, I escaped to beat rugs and sweep leaves on the hotel roof. One Monday, however, I heard footsteps ringing on the ladder. It was Clara. She saw me and froze.<br><br> Bruises were thickening all over her arms. They were that brilliant pansy-blue, the beautiful color that belies its origins. Automatically, I crossed the roof to her. We clacked skeletons; to call it an &#x201c;embrace&#x201d; would misrepresent the violence of our first collision. To soothe her, I heard myself making stupid jokes, babbling inanities about the weather, asking in my vague and meandering way what could be done to help her; I could not bring myself to say, plainly,&nbsp;<i>Who did this to you</i>? Choking on my only real question, I offered her my cardigan&#x2014;the way you&#x2019;d hand a sick person a tissue. She put it on. She buttoned all the buttons. You couldn&#x2019;t tell that anything was wrong now. This amazed me, that a covering so thin could erase her bruises. I&#x2019;d half-expected them to bore holes through the wool.<br><br> &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t worry, O.K.?&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;I promise, it&#x2019;s nothing.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;I won&#x2019;t tell,&#x201d; I blurted out&#x2014;although of course I had nothing to tell beyond what I&#x2019;d glimpsed. Night fell, and I was shivering now, so Clara held me. Something subtle and real shifted inside our embrace&#x2014;nothing detectable to an observer, but a change I registered in my bones. For the duration of our friendship, we&#x2019;d trade off roles like this: anchor and boat, beholder and beheld. We must have looked like some Janus-faced statue, our chins pointing east and west. An unembarrassed silence seemed to be on loan to us from the distant future, where we were already friends. Then I heard her say, staring over my shoulder at the darkening sea: &#x201c;What would you be, Aubby, if you lived somewhere else?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;I&#x2019;d be a prospector,&#x201d; I told her, without batting an eye. &#x201c;I&#x2019;d be a prospector of the prospectors. I&#x2019;d wait for luck to strike them, and then I&#x2019;d take their gold.&#x201d;<br><br> Clara laughed and I joined in, amazed&#x2014;until this moment, I hadn&#x2019;t considered that my days at the hotel might be eclipsing other sorts of lives. Clara Finisterre was someone whom I thought of as having a fate to escape, but I wouldn&#x2019;t have dignified my own prospects that way, by calling them &#x201c;a fate.&#x201d;<br><br> A week later, Clara took&nbsp;me to a d�butante ball at a tacky mansion that looked rabid to me, frothy with white marble balconies. She introduced me as &#x201c;my best friend, Aubergine.&#x201d; Thus began our secret life. We sifted through the closets and the jewelry boxes of our hosts. Clara tutored me in the social graces, and I taught Clara what to take, and how to get away with it.<br><br> One night, Clara came to find me on the roof. She was blinking muddily out of two black eyes. Who was doing this&#x2014;Mr. Finisterre? Someone from the hotel? She refused to say. I made a deal with Clara: she never had to tell me who, but we had to leave Florida.<br><br> The next day, we found ourselves at the train station, with all our clothes and savings.<br><br> Those first weeks alone were an education. The West was very poor at that moment, owing to the Depression. But it was still home to many aspiring and expiring millionaires, and we made it our job to make their acquaintance. One aging oil speculator paid for our meals and our transit and required only that we absorb his memories; Clara nicknamed him the &#x201c;allegedly legendary wit.&#x201d; He had three genres of tale: business victories; sporting adventures that ended in the death of mammals; and eulogies for his former virility.<br><br> We met mining captains and fishing captains, whose whiskers quivered like those of orphaned seals. The freckled heirs to timber fortunes. Glazy baronial types, with portentous and misguided names: Romulus and Creon, who were pleased to invite us to gala dinners, and to use us as their gloating mirrors. In exchange for this service, Clara and I helped ourselves to many fine items from their houses. Clara had a magic satchel that seemed to expand with our greed, and we stole everything it could swallow. Dessert spoons, candlesticks, a poodle&#x2019;s jewelled collar. We strode out of parties wearing our hostess&#x2019;s two-toned heels, woozy with adrenaline. Crutched along by Clara&#x2019;s sturdy charm, I was swung through doors that led to marmoreal courtyards and curtained salons and, in many cases, master bedrooms, where my skin glowed under the warm reefs of artificial lighting.<br><br> But winter hit, and our mining prospects dimmed considerably. The Oregon coastline was laced with ghost towns; two paper mills had closed, and whole counties had gone bankrupt. Men were flocking inland to the mountains, where the rumor was that the W.P.A. had work for construction teams. I told Clara that we needed to follow them. So we thumbed a ride with a group of work-starved Astoria teen-agers who had heard about the Evergreen Lodge. Gold dust had drawn the first prospectors to these mountains; those boys were after the weekly three-dollar salary. But if government money was snowing onto Mt. Joy, it had yet to reach the town below. I&#x2019;d made a bad miscalculation, suggesting Lucerne. Our first night in town, Clara and I stared at our faces superimposed over the dark storefront windows. In the boarding house, we lay awake in the dark, pretending to believe in each other&#x2019;s theatrical sleep; only our bellies were honest, growling at each other.&nbsp;<i>Why did you bring us here</i>? Clara never dreamed of asking me. With her generous amnesia, she seemed already to have forgotten that leaving home had been my idea.<br><br> Day after day, I told Clara not to worry: &#x201c;We just need one good night.&#x201d; We kept lying to each other, pretending that our hunger was part of the game. Social graces get you meagre results in a shuttered town. We started haunting the bars around the C.C.C. camps. The gaunt men there had next to nothing, and I felt a pang lifting anything from them. Back in the boarding house, our fingers spidering through wallets, we barely spoke to each other. Clara and I began to disappear into adjacent rooms with strangers.&nbsp;<i>She was better off before</i>, my mind whispered. For the first time since we&#x2019;d left Florida, it occurred to me that our expedition might fail.<b><br></b></p><h2>Monica the Marshmallow Fairy: A Rainbow Magic Book (The Sweet Fairies #1): A Rainbow Magic Book (1)</h2><p>Join Rachel and Kirsty on their sweetest-ever fairy adventure!<br><br>Kirsty and Rachel are delighted to be invited to Fairyland for the annual Candy Harvest.

Colonel Ronald Waskul laid down the olive-green file folder and stared across his desk at the twenty-nine-year-old Marine Corps officer. Waskul liked how the major's gunmetal-gray eyes focused like a laser as he absorbed every word. As it should be.</p> <p>Tapping the report, the colonel added gruffly, "This construction project is important. You will be there for two years, laying the groundwork and facilitating the building of a historic building of a small coal-fired power plant in that country. Afghanistan has very little electricity and has no power plants inland because there are no lakes and rivers. The U.S. government at the highest levels of the State Department are working with an international consortium of construction companies to provide more energy to this region."</p> <p>Pete Trayhern was sweating heavily in his dark green wool uniform. He could see it was snowing outside the window behind Colonel Waskul's gray head. A late and unexpected April storm had dumped two feet of the white stuff on Washington, D.C. Pete had just arrived off a transport that had flown him in from Germany. Despite the crazy weather, perspiration beaded his upper lip, and he had the wild desire to wipe it off with the back of his hand. But he didn't dare. According to his father, Morgan Trayhern, the colonel was a king maker in his own right. They had worked on many covert projects together over the last decade, and Pete knew his father idolized the rough-hewn Marine officer. </p> <p>"Yes, sir, I got a briefing on it before I left my old construction job. I'm sure it shows in my personnel file. I served as an assitant company commander in Kandahar for a year, so I'm not unfamiliar with the country. I'm gung ho on these new orders, Colonel Waskul, and I'm the right man for the job." With his background as a mechanical engineer, graduating from Annapolis four years earlier, Pete had since made a name for himself as an assistant site-construction superintendent. And yet he wondered if his highly influential father, who ran a CIA covert group, had anything to do with this latest development. Pete had known that his two years at the German construction site were up and that he would be transferred, but he hadn't known where. Until now.</p> <p>Waskul grunted and opened another folder. His thick gray brows turned down. "Yes, your assignment to Kandahar as an assistant company commander is part of the reason you're here. I've carefully gone over your construction record, Major Trayhern. We ran the requirements through the Pentagon computers and came up with five finalists. You were first on that list." Tapping the folder, he added, "You've got a background in bringing electrical substations online, and your last job was building a power plant in its start-up phase near Berlin. You kept that job on schedule and on budget. In today's environment, the U.S. government is <i>very</i> concerned about meeting all these goals." </p> <p>He stared at Pete. "Colonel James Flint, your past supervisor, has glowing remarks about how effective you were in liaising with civilian construction companies and getting their work completed within the contract requirements."</p> <p>"Yes, sir, the old carrot-and-stick routine." Pete started to smile, but quickly wiped it off his face when Colonel Waskul frowned even more. Pete hated these</p> <p>"official" meetings with superiors. Truth be known, he'd rather be out clomping around in the field with D9 Caterpillars, growling earthmovers and noisy backhoes than sitting in the stifling, stuffy confines of a Pentagon office. He yearned to be out in the cold, crisp air, drawing it deeply into his lungs. Fighting jet lag and no sleep in the last forty-eight hours, Pete felt rummy. As he held the colonel's icy blue stare, he did his best to remain alert and appear interested. </p> <p>"Well, you're going to need every carrot, stick and donkey you've got up your sleeve to coordinate this mission, Major Trayhern," Waskul growled, handing Pete the folder. "This time, you are going to head up the project. You're no longer the assistant. And this isn't Italy or Germany. Afghanistan is a third world country. You speak fluent German and Italian. But where you're going, Farsi and Pashto are the languages spoken, along with a multitude of tribal and regional dialects. Your workers are going to be Afghans, as well as other hard hats from around the world." His brows rose and he sat back. "You've got your work cut out for you."</p> <p>Looking down at the overflowing file on the power plant project, Pete murmured, "Yes, sir. I understand this is a very different and difficult project." As he looked back up, he smiled just a little at Colonel Waskul's bulldog features. "I'm confident that I can handle it, sir. And I appreciate the confidence the Navy has in me to do just that." </p> <p>Now the Marine Corps was a sub-branch of the U.S. Navy, although no Marine liked to admit it. Still the Navy construction branch was well known as a "can-do." Pete was sure this was partly responsible for him receiving this assignment. Pete was one of many officers from various military branches that were sent interservice, to projects around the world. Although he was a Marine, he had worked for the Air Force at his first job, in Italy, and for the U.S. Army in Germany on his second tour. Specialties such as his were shared among the branches. "That's youth talking," Waskul muttered, giving him a cutting, one-cornered smile. "You have seven days of leave, Major. I suggest you get a good night's sleep and show up here tomorrow morning at the Pentagon. Fill your Blackberry and laptop with information you're going to need and then your father is expecting you home."</p> <p>"Yes, sir, I'll be here at 0800 tomorrow morning to pick up the details of the project."</p> <p>"Give my best to your dad. He's one hell of a Marine, and it's always a pleasure to work with him and his companies." Standing, Waskul watched as the major sprang to his feet at attention. "At ease," he said, thrusting his hand across the desk to Trayhern. "I can't stress enough how critical this project is, Major. If you do this right, you'll be in one helluva position for early lieutenant-colonel's leaves. The Afghan government is hinging a lot on this power plant and it's political as hell. If people start getting electricity inland, the government feels the regional tribal sheiks will be more cooperative, rather than fomenting uprisings to tear that country apart again. Got it?"</p> <p>Pete relaxed and shook the tough Marine's callused hand. "Yes, sir, I got it. I'll make you proud of me, sir. That's a promise."</p> <p>Nodding, Waskul released his grip. "In my late twenties I thought I could conquer the world, too, Major. Just remember, you're going to be working with an international mix of construction companies. Everyone speaks different languages and does things their own way. You have to weave them into one machine, with one heart, one mind and one focus on the goals you set for them. Your father says you have what it takes. I'm counting on you...."</p> <p>"PETE! WELCOME HOME!" Laura Trayhern's voice sang through the hall as her son stepped in the doorway. </p> <p>"Hi, Mom." Pete grinned and opened his arms as she dashed toward him. </p> <p>"Welcome home, sweetheart! We've missed you so much!" After hugging her second son fiercely, she planted several kisses on his clean-shaven cheek.</p> <p>"Sorry I couldn't get home sooner," Pete said, pulling back so that he could get a good look at her. Simple and elegant in black slacks and a white blouse, Laura Tray-hern was in her fifties, but to Pete, she seemed so much younger. </p> <p>He hung up his coat and lifted his nose in the air. "What's that I smell? My favorite meal cooking? Am I in time for lunch?" He grinned widely, his heart expanding as his mother took his arm and drew him down the polished, golden-red cedar hall and into the bright, airy kitchen.</p> <p>"Yes, your favorite. Beef stroganoff. Your father will be here any minute. I decided to make it for lunch instead of dinner." </p> <p>Pete felt the tension he'd been carrying in his shoulders dissolve. He'd hitched a ride on a commercial flight from D.C. to Anaconda, Montana. From there, he'd rented a car and driven to Phillipsburg, a very small town nestled deep in the Rocky Mountains. The weather had cooperated; it was spring here, with patches of snow left, but greenery and wildflowers popping up after a long, severe winter.</p> <p>"Where's Kammie?" Pete asked, looking around. She was the youngest of his sisters. The table was set to perfection with sparkling glassware, colorful china plates and glistening flatware. His mother was one hell of a cook, and Pete always appreciated the homey nest she'd made for all of them growing up. </p> <p>"She's in school. Normally, she doesn't come home at noon." Laura smiled as she pulled the casserole out of the oven and placed it on a trivet in the center of the table. "You'll see her tonight."</p> <p>"I've missed her. She's really grown up in the last two years." Kamaria Trayhern was the fifth child in their family. Pete recalled the infant girl being brought back from Los Angeles after a deadly earthquake had devastated southern California years earlier. Kamaria had been found beneath the body of her dead mother. Pete's own mom had suffered a broken ankle and been trapped in the rubble of a hotel for days. </p> <p>After being rescued, Kamaria had been flown to the Camp Reed Marine Base to recover. Many children without parents had been cared for at the huge medical facility. Laura, who had been bedridden, had volunteered to help out by bottle-feeding little Kamaria. And had fallen in love with the little black-haired tyke. </p> <p>Pete had been a teen then, and he recalled the phone call from his parents to him and his fraternal twin, Kelly, about bringing the baby home and adopting her. He'd thought it was a great idea. And through the years, as Kammie grew up, she'd been a continuous blessing to the family. Pete and Kelly had been especially close to their adopted little sister. He always appreciated the e-mails and pictures she sent from her computer. Kammie was a photo bug of the first order. Two years ago, Pete had given her a cheap digital camera for her birthday, and a photographer had been born. Ever since, Kammie took pictures of the family and routinely sent them to him so he wouldn't feel homesick. She wanted to grow up and be a professional photographer who worked for a major international news organization, wanting to follow in Kelly's footsteps and lead an adventurous life. Kammie idolized her big sister. Kelly had left the Marine Corps aviation as a helicopter pilot and had been flying the Sirkorsky Sky Crane for Shaheen Aviation. Kelly fought wildfires across the globe with her helo that could fly in 3000 gallons of water on a raging forest fire. Kammie doted on red-haired Kelly's brave acts and dreamed of an adventurous life when she graduated from college someday. </p></p><h2>Moone Boy 3: The Notion Potion (3)</h2><p>Martin Moone is about to finish primary school and feels he hasn&#39;t achieved very much.

A major figure of the American left, Harrington is the author of eighteen books including <em>The Other America: Poverty in the United States</em>, <em>The Social-Industrial Complex</em>, <em>The Twilight of Capitalism</em>, and his autobiography <em>The Long Distance Runner</em>. He passed away in 1989.As this may be Harrington's last major work (he is battling inoperable cancer), it is worthy of careful attention even though it covers some familiar territory. It is both a condensation of and a sequel to his massive theoretical study Socialism ( LJ 6/1/72), and it also refines and supports arguments put forth in writings such as Toward a Democratic Left ( LJ 3/15/68) and The Next Left ( LJ 1/15/84). He argues that socialist renewal is the only hope for progress and freedom in the next century and he tries to clear away the "deadwood of the socialist past." He is convincing in his application of classic socialist theory to current economic situations, and he examines the validity of the idea of "visionary gradualism" in bringing about a socialist agenda.

No issue has become more controversial than gender-neutral Bible translations. Vern Poythress and Wayne Grudem examine the translation practice of replacing the generic &#34;he&#34; and the specific &#34;father&#34; with the gender-neutral &#34;they&#34; and &#34;parent.&#34; While translators may be well intentioned in seeking not to offend, Poythress and Grudem contend that the results are subtly changed meanings of the original texts and less-than-accurate translations. Throughout, however, the authors seek to build a dialogue that will result in understanding both sides of the gender-neutral controversy and the challenge of producing accurate Bible translations.</p><p>Vern S.

Persico explores FDR&#x2019;s romance with Lucy Rutherfurd. Persico&#x2019;s provocative conclusions about their relationship are informed by a revealing range of sources, including never-before-published letters and documents from Lucy Rutherfurd&#x2019;s estate that attest to the intensity of the affair, which lasted much longer than was previously acknowledged.FDR&#x2019;s connection with Lucy also creates an opportunity for Persico to take a more penetrating look at the other women in FDR&#x2019;s life. We come to&nbsp;see more clearly how FDR&#x2019;s infidelity contributed to Eleanor Roosevelt&#x2019;s&nbsp;eventual transformation from a repressed Victorian to perhaps the greatest American woman of her century; how FDR&#x2019;s strong-willed mother helped to strengthen his resolve in overcoming personal and public adversity; and how both paramours and platonic friends completed the world that FDR&nbsp;inhabited.

His country was at war. He was thirty-six years old and bursting with vitality. Before going to work in the morning at the Navy Department he often played a round of golf. On weekends, he rarely got in less than thirty-six holes. During the week he worked out with Walter Camp, the football coach and fitness enthusiast. Lathrop Brown, his Harvard roommate, was serving in the new tank corps. Harry Hooker, his former law partner, was now Major Hooker, on the staff of the 53rd Division American Expeditionary Forces. Another law partner and Harvard pal, Langdon Marvin, was driving an ambulance in France with the Red Cross. His four distant cousins, Archibald, Kermit, Theodore Jr., and Quentin, sons of Franklin&#x2019;s idol, former President Theodore Roosevelt, had all enlisted. The exploits of TR&#x2019;s boys filled the newspapers, arousing in Franklin competing emotions of pride and envy. Even his nearsighted brother-in-law, Hall Roosevelt, had volunteered. <br><br>On the very day that war had been declared, April 6, 1917, the Roosevelt clan gathered at the home of TR&#x2019;s married daughter, Alice Roosevelt Longworth. There the former commander-in-chief seized Franklin by the shoulders, fixed him with his myopic gaze, and pleaded with him to resign as assistant secretary of the navy. &#x201c;You must get into uniform at once,&#x201d; TR urged. &#x201c;You must get in.&#x201d; <br><br>Franklin was all too willing. Patriotism was the main reason, but politics intruded as well. In 1898, when America had gone to war against Spain over Cuba, TR had resigned from the very Navy post Franklin now held. He had formed his own regiment, the Rough Riders. He had worn the uniform, known war, and subsequently reached the political pinnacle. TR&#x2019;s trajectory was not lost on his ambitious young relative. Franklin&#x2019;s chief, Navy Secretary Josephus Daniels, easily detected the parallels. &#x201c;Theodore left the position of assistant secretary to become a Rough Rider, later Governor of New York and then President, and both had served in the legislature of New York,&#x201d; Daniels noted. &#x201c;Franklin actually thought fighting in the War was the necessary step toward reaching the White House.&#x201d; Franklin&#x2019;s mother, Sara, had recently written her son, &#x201c;The papers say buttons and pictures of you are being prepared to run for Governor.&#x201d; But Franklin preferred to take TR&#x2019;s route, military service first. <br><br>Theodore Roosevelt, now fifty-nine, blind in one eye, partially deaf, his body racked by punishing expeditions into the disease-infested Brazilian jungle, was itching to answer his country&#x2019;s call again. He hoped to raise a volunteer division just as he had raised a regiment in the earlier war. He pleaded with Franklin to get him an appointment with President Woodrow Wilson. This request could prove ticklish. Ever since TR, as a third-party candidate, had been beaten by Wilson five years before in the 1912 presidential election, he had been lambasting the winner for everything from woolly-headedness to cowardice for not getting America into the European war sooner. Nevertheless, the day after the Roosevelt gathering at cousin Alice&#x2019;s house, Franklin did go to the secretary of war, Newton Baker, and persuade him to intervene with Wilson on TR&#x2019;s behalf. The president would later say of meeting with his old foe, &#x201c;I was charmed by his personality . . . you can&#x2019;t resist the man.&#x201d; Evidently he was able to resist, since he told Baker afterward, &#x201c;I really think the best way to treat Mr. Roosevelt is to take no notice of him.&#x201d; TR was baffled by Wilson&#x2019;s failure to seize upon his heartfelt offer. As he left the White House with Wilson&#x2019;s confidant, Colonel Edward M. House, he complained, &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t understand. After all, I&#x2019;m only asking to be allowed to die,&#x201d; to which House reportedly responded, &#x201c;Oh, did you make that point quite clear to the President?&#x201d;<br><br>Uncle Ted had not made it back into uniform himself, but his admonition still echoed in Franklin&#x2019;s ear: &#x201c;I should be ashamed of my sons if they shirked war.&#x201d; After TR&#x2019;s White House visit, Franklin did submit his resignation as assistant secretary in order to enlist. But when the letter landed on Wilson&#x2019;s desk, the president rejected what he considered military romanticism. He told Secretary Daniels to inform his subordinate that he was no different from any draftee. &#x201c;Neither you nor I nor Franklin Roosevelt has the right to select the place of service,&#x201d; he warned. &#x201c;Tell the young man . . . to stay where he is.&#x201d; Unfazed, Roosevelt next went to Wilson personally, only to be turned down again. The rejection, nevertheless, did illuminate Roosevelt&#x2019;s rising star. Wilson&#x2019;s former Army chief of staff, General Leonard Wood, observed that &#x201c;Franklin Roosevelt should under no circumstances think of leaving the Navy Department; that would amount to a public calamity.&#x201d; The real power in the U.S. Navy, Wood believed, was not Secretary Daniels, but his aggressive deputy. <br><br>As the country entered its fifteenth month of the war a still frustrated Franklin managed to wangle an assignment that lifted him, if not exactly to combatant status, at least to something more than a deskbound civilian. He urged Secretary Daniels to allow him to go to Europe &#x201c;to look into our Naval administration in order to work more closely with the other services.&#x201d; The essentially pacifist Daniels felt no necessity himself to witness the bloodletting firsthand and eventually yielded to Franklin&#x2019;s ceaseless importuning, even allowing his assistant to write his own orders, essentially a blank check to pursue &#x201c;such other purposes as may be deemed expedient upon your arrival.&#x201d; Franklin confided to his wife that he had been promised a commission as a Navy lieutenant commander upon his return. Before leaving, he sent President Wilson a letter saying he hoped the speculation about his running for governor of New York would end. He was not going to &#x201c;give up war work for what is frankly very much a local political job in these times.&#x201d; <br><br>That summer of 1918, as the day of his departure approached, his behavior began taking on an air of mystery. He told Eleanor only that he must leave her alone with their five children, but could not disclose where he was going or for how long. She was not to see him off, since the mission was secret. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t tell a soul,&#x201d; he warned her, &#x201c;not even Mama.&#x201d; Franklin had one more goodbye to make before he left, one unknown to Eleanor, and one that moved him to mixed longing and pride. Meeting secretly, he and a beautiful woman made impassioned promises of letters to be exchanged, how this was to be safely carried out during his absence, and what needed to be resolved on his return, for Franklin Roosevelt was in love. <br><br>He sailed for Europe from the Washington Navy Yard on July 9, 1918, aboard the destroyer USS Dyer, rushed into service just eight days before and heading into the war zone without benefit of sea trials. Despite his position, he told his wife that he had requested no ceremonies. Once aboard ship, Franklin started a diary, the basis for a book he intended to write, an intention that showed through in the grandiloquence of his first entry: &#x201c;The good old ocean is so absolutely normal just as it always has been, sometimes tumbling about and throwing spray, sometimes gently lolling about . . . but now though the ocean looks much unchanged the doubled number of lookouts shows that even here the hand of the Hun False God is reaching out to defy nature; ten miles ahead of this floating City of Souls a torpedo maybe waiting to start on its quick run.&#x201d; <br><br>The Dyer joined a troop convoy delivering another twenty thousand doughboys to the over one million already in France: &#x201c;a wonderful sight,&#x201d; Franklin noted in the diary, &#x201c;five monsters in the half light . . . it thrills to think that right there another division is on the way to the front.&#x201d; Every element of danger quickened his sense that at last he was in the war, as when the Dyer zigzagged to thwart marauding U-boats, &#x201c;9 different course changes,&#x201d; in an hour; and when he learned that &#x201c;only 15 or 16 of the crew&#x201d; had ever been in the war zone; and when he was assigned his abandon ship station, whale boat number 2, should the worst happen. <br><br>He was gone just over ten weeks. Looking back, he counted the mission a brilliant success. He had met personally with all the Allied leaders, the fiery British prime minister, David Lloyd George, whom Franklin was delighted to find &#x201c;is just like his pictures.&#x201d; Even more impressive to Roosevelt, with his weakness for royalty, was a private audience at Buckingham Palace with King George V. Franklin recorded in his diary that the king had given him forty minutes alone and seemed genuinely impressed that his American visitor had crossed the Atlantic on a warship. &#x201c;His one regret,&#x201d; the king told him, &#x201c;was that it had been impossible for him to do active Naval service during the war,&#x201d; reflecting Franklin&#x2019;s own disappointment. The king then confided that though he had blood relatives in Germany, particularly Kaiser Wilhelm, &#x201c;in all my life I have never seen a German gentleman.&#x201d; <br><br>Franklin had next gone on to France, where he was again welcomed at the summit, meeting French president Raymond Poincair� and premier Georges Clemenceau. &#x201c;I was in the presence of the greatest civilian in France,&#x201d; he wrote in his diary of Clemenceau. &#x201c;He almost ran forward to meet me and shook hands as if he meant it.&#x201d; The sixty-six-year-old premier, known as &#x201c;The Tiger,&#x201d; related to Roosevelt a thrilling account of his recent visit to the front where a French and German soldier were found &#x201c;trying to bite each other to death when a shell had killed them both,&#x201d; their upright bodies still clinched. &#x201c;And as he told me this,&#x201d; Franklin recalled, &#x201c;he grabbed me by both shoulders and shook me with a grip of steel.&#x201d; Before the mission was over Franklin had met with Marshal Ferdinand Foch, commanding all Allied forces, the leader of the British army, Field Marshal Douglas Haig, General John &#x201c;Black Jack&#x201d; Pershing, commander of the American Expeditionary Forces, and Italy&#x2019;s prime minister, Vittorio Orlando&#x2014;everyone who was anyone in the war.<br><br>At each stop he checked eagerly with the Army postal service and the American embassy&#x2019;s diplomatic pouch for letters from his wife, his mother, and his secret passion. <br><br>Though he savored his reception at the top, for Franklin, these moments paled alongside what had been the real objective of the trip. Before it was over, he could claim, with enough justification to satisfy his ego, that he had seen the face of war. His military escort, the American naval attach� in Paris, Captain R. H. Jackson, had interpreted his orders as making sure that Assistant Secretary Roosevelt came through this journey with his hide intact. As Franklin put it, Jackson&#x2019;s &#x201c;plans called for easy trips and plenty of bombed houses thirty miles or so behind the front.&#x201d; He brushed Jackson aside and &#x201c;from now on for four days I ran the trip,&#x201d; he wrote Eleanor. <br><br>Wearing vaguely military dress of his own invention&#x2014;khaki pants tucked into leather puttees, a gray knee-length coat, a French army helmet, and a gas mask looped around his neck&#x2014;he arrived at Verdun where the previous year the French and Germans had bled each other white with losses totaling 696,000 men. He was standing at an angle in a road snapping pictures of a devastated village, when an officer raced out and yanked him to safety just as &#x201c;the long whining whistle of a shell was followed by the dull boom and a puff of smoke of the explosion at the Dead Man&#x2019;s Corner we had just left.&#x201d; He added in the diary, &#x201c;It is indeed quite evident that we are on the battlefield.&#x201d; <br><br>He was briefly embarrassed at another village where a great bang of artillery sent him diving for cover. It turned out that a well-concealed American battery was firing into the German lines. The artillerymen howled with laughter as Franklin rose and dusted himself off. His equanimity quickly recovered, he strode over and greeted the doughboys with hearty handshakes. As they reloaded, they allowed him to pull the gun&#x2019;s lanyard, propelling a shell toward the German lines. Years later, retelling this experience he would say, &#x201c;I will never know how many, if any, Huns I killed.&#x201d; <br><br>Roosevelt did eventually witness the end product of war. In Belleau Wood, site of America&#x2019;s first full-scale battle, he slogged through oozing mud, weaving his way around water-logged shell holes, and came upon &#x201c;discarded overcoats, rain-stained love letters . . . and many little mounds, some wholly unmarked, some with a rifle stuck, bayonet down, in the earth, some with a helmet, and some too with a whittled cross with a tag of wood or wrapping paper hung over it and in a pencil scrawl an American name.&#x201d; The sight of these Marine graves especially moved Roosevelt since the Corps was under the Navy Department. He asked an officer to show him a list of the latest casualties among &#x201c;my Marines,&#x201d; which revealed 760 killed and three times as many wounded. The sight of German dead moved him not at all. Near Rheims he came upon a stack of unburied enemy corpses and found the stench an offense to &#x201c;our sensitive naval nostrils.&#x201d; Before leaving the war zone, Franklin authorized the Marines to wear the Corps insignia on their collars, though they were under Army command. He did so without consulting Washington. How else, he told friends, could he get anything done? When, during the mission, he met a Harvard acquaintance, Robert Dunn, who asked, &#x201c;How&#x2019;s the job and Josephus?,&#x201d; referring to Franklin&#x2019;s chief, Franklin answered, &#x201c;Gosh, you don&#x2019;t know, Bobby, what I have to bear under that man.&#x201d; <br><br>Back in Paris he stopped to visit his Roosevelt kin in a house near the Arc de Triomphe. There he found two of TR&#x2019;s sons, Archie and Ted Jr., recuperating from serious wounds. Another brother, Kermit, had volunteered for a machine gun unit. He &#x201c;will at no very distant time share the fate of his brothers,&#x201d; TR had written. The younger Roosevelts spoke somberly but proudly of Quentin, the youngest brother. On July 14, Bastille Day, while Franklin was still aboard the Dyer, Quentin had flown his French Nieuport 28 behind German lines near Ch�teau-Thierry where a Fokker shot him out of the sky and to his death. TR put up a brave front, but a friend, Hermann Hagedorn, observed that after the death of his son in a war he had so vigorously supported, &#x201c;the boy in him had died.&#x201d; The effect of these calamities on his cousins only sharpened Franklin&#x2019;s eagerness to get into uniform. <br><br>He ended his European adventure in a frenzy of activity, fearful that he might miss something. He began a marathon inspection of airfields and Navy bases from the Spanish border to Brest. He slept on the floor of a barn, his sleep broken by an artillery bombardment and two air raids, followed by lunch the next day with King Albert of Belgium. Then it was up to Scotland&#x2019;s Firth of Forth to inspect the British Grand Fleet, a squadron of American battleships, and to ride in a Navy dirigible. He wrote Eleanor of his &#x201c;frightfully busy week on the road each day from 6 am to midnight.&#x201d; Most gratifying, back in France, he was able to see a tactic of his own invention come to life. American cruisers carried fourteen-inch guns that could hurl a shell twenty-five miles. Why not place them on railroad flatcars, Franklin had urged, and have them blast deeply deployed German fortifications? He inspected, with ill-concealed pride, the first rail-borne guns headed for the front, with large white letters painted on the side reading &#x201c;U.S.N.&#x201d;</p><h2>Toddler Rhyme Bible</h2><p>The fun-time, anytime, read-aloud Bible rhyme!

"You're named after a flower!" teases Victoria. "Let's smell her," says Jo. Chrysanthemum wilts. What will it take to make her blossom again?</p><p>This popular picture book has sold more than a million copies and was named a Notable Book for Children by the American Library Association. "Perfectly executed in words and illustration, <em>Chrysanthemum</em> exemplifies Henkes's talent for creating true picture stories for young audiences."&#x2014;<em>The Horn Book</em></p><p>Supports the Common Core State Standards</p></p><p>Until Chrysanthemum started kindergarten, she believed her parents when they said her name was perfect. But on the first day of school, Chrysanthemum begins to suspect that her name is far less than perfect, especially when her class dissolves into giggles upon hearing her name read aloud. That evening, Chrysanthemum's parents try to piece her self-esteem back together again with comfort food and a night filled "with hugs, kisses, and Parcheesi." But the next day Victoria, a particularly observant and mean-spirited classmate, announces that Chrysanthemum's name takes up 13 letters. "That's half the letters in the alphabet!" she adds. Chrysanthemum wilts. Pretty soon the girls are making playground threats to "pluck" Chrysanthemum and "smell her." <p> Kevin Henkes has great compassion for the victims of childhood teasing and cruelties--using fresh language, endearing pen-and-ink mouse characters, and realistic dialogue to portray real-life vulnerability. He also has great compassion for parents, offering several adult-humor jokes for anxious mommies and daddies. On the surface, the finale is overly tidy and the coincidences unbelievable. But in the end, what sustains Chrysanthemum, as well as this story, is the steadfast love and support of her family. And because of this, the closure is ultimately convincing and utterly comforting.

Then the students were introduced to their music teacher, Mrs. Twinkle. Mrs. <em>Delphinium</em> Twinkle. And suddenly, Chrysanthemum blossomed....</p></p><h2>Satantango</h2><p>In the darkening embers of a Communist utopia, life in a desolate Hungarian town has come to a virtual standstill. Flies buzz, spiders weave, water drips and animals root desultorily in the barnyard of a collective farm. But when the charismatic Irimias - long-thought dead - returns to the commune, the villagers fall under his spell. The Devil has arrived in their midst. Irimias will divide and rule: his arrival heralds the beginning of a period of violence and greed for the villagers as he sets about swindling them out of a fortune that might allow them to escape the emptiness and futility of their existence. He soon attains a messianic aura as he plays on the fears of the townsfolk and a series of increasingly brutal events unfold. Satantango follows the villagers as they are exploited and taken in by Irimias; as they drink and stumble their way toward the gradual realization of their mistake and ultimate demise. In its measured prose and long, Tolstoyan sentences, Satantango is nothing short of a literary masterpiece; a formal meditation on death and avarice, human fallibility and faith.</p><p>Laszlo Krasznahorkai is a Hungarian writer born in 1954. Krasznahorkai has been honoured with numerous literary prizes, among them the highest award of the Hungarian state, the Kossuth Prize and, in 1993, the German Bestenliste Prize for the best literary work of the year.&#39;A masterpiece of modern European literature. Brilliant, unforgiving, gripping. Essential reading for anyone wishing to comprehend the dark heart of the 20th century.&#39; * Alex Preston, author of This Bleeding City * I fell in love with the fierce, barbed intelligence in his sentences... Krasznahorkai is the kind of writer who at least once on every page finds a way of expressing something one has always sensed but never known, let alone been able to describe. -- Nicole Krauss Like something far down the periodic table of elements, Krasznahorkai&#39;s sentences are strange, elusive, frighteningly radioactive. They seek to replicate the entropic whirl of consciousness itself... Haunting, pleasantly weird and, ultimately, bigger than the worlds they inhabit. -- Jacob Silverman * New York Times Book Review * Regarded as a classic, [Satantango] is a monster of a novel: compact, cleverly constructed, often exhilarating, and possessed of a distinctive, compelling vision... It is brutal, relentless and so amazingly bleak that it&#39;s often quite funny. This is an obviously brilliant novel. Krasznahorkai is a visionary writer... The grandeur is clearly palpable. -- Theo Tait * Guardian * Intoxicating and exhilarating, bleak yet beautiful, Satantango is a modern masterpiece that manages to speak both of its time and to transcend it altogether. -- Beth Jones * Sunday Telegraph * This majestic translation finally gives us its inimitable, nightmarish pleasures at first hand. * Sunday Times *</p><h2>Facilitation Techniques in Therapeutic Recreation</h2><p>This book contains 18 chapters, each of which is devoted to presenting a specific facilitation technique.Each chapter provides definitions of terms relevant to the facilitation technique.

Michael Prichard's reading is excellent, although his characterization of Archie Goodwin, Wolfe's sidekick, is a tougher character than I'd expected, far different, at least, from the most recent portrayal by Timothy Hutton on A&amp;E. His erudite Nero Wolfe is right on the money. Prichard's style of narration gives the story a somewhat hard-boiled interpretation that is enjoyable. Even if you've read the book, this one is worth a listen.

This book, edited by his son, will introduce a new generation to Watts' lucid and readable re-creation of Eastern philosophies--particularly Hinduism, Buddhism, and Taoism--in a Western context. <i>Re-creation</i> is exactly the right word for what Watts did, because, as he pointed out in variation after variation, the play's the thing, and the thing is to play it. <i>The Philosophies of Asia</i> combines transcripts of eight talks that Watts gave between 1965 and 1972. Because the collection retains the character of oral presentation, it is a lively place to encounter both Watts and the philosophies he discusses. And because the combination of encounter and re-creation is appropriate to both speaker and subject matter, the collection serves as a fine introduction to Watts as much as to the philosophies of Asia. <i>Steve Schroeder</i></p><h2>Truth for Today Commentary: Life of Christ, 1 A Supplement</h2><p>Every Christian should thrill at the reading of the Gospel Accounts.

Incantation is Hoffman's fifth young adult novel.<br>INCANTATION is Hoffman's fifth novel aimed at the young adult audience. As always, Hoffman takes chances with her story. Here, her attempt to explore the Spanish Inquisition and its witch hunts within the context of a 16-year-old's crush on her best friend's cousin would seem to present insurmountable odds. Unfortunately, Jenna Lamia's saccharine voice, which would be more appropriate for reading a fairy tale, presents an even more significant obstacle. She also reads rapidly, as if racing to get to the end. Her tone deepens a bit as disastrous events unfold, but the upbeat peppiness with which her narration begins prevails in the listener's mind.

Reprint.</p><p><i>Expecting Adam</i> is an autobiographical tale of an academically oriented Harvard couple who conceive a baby with Down's syndrome and decide to carry him to term. Despite everything Martha Beck and her husband John know about themselves and their belief system, when Martha gets accidentally pregnant and the fetus is discovered to have Down's syndrome, the Becks find they cannot even consider abortion. The presence of the fetus that they each, privately, believe is a familiar being named Adam is too strong. As Martha's terribly difficult pregnancy progresses, odd coincidences and paranormal experiences begin to occur for both Martha and John, though for months they don't share them with each other. Martha's pregnancy and Adam (once born) become the catalyst for tremendous life changes for the Becks.<p> Focusing primarily on the pregnancy but floating back and forth between the present and recent and distant past, Martha Beck's well-written, down-to-earth, funny, heart-rending, and tender book transcends the cloying tone of much spiritual literature. Beck is trained as a methodical academician. Because of her step-by-step explanation of her own progress from doubt to belief, she feels like a reliable witness, and even the most skeptical readers may begin to doubt their senses. When she describes an out-of-body experience, we, too, feel ourselves transported to a pungent, noisy hawker center in Singapore. We, too, feel calming, invisible, supporting hands when she falls. Yet, whether or not readers believe in Beck's experiences is ultimately a moot point. There is no doubt that Adam--a boy who sees the world as a series of connections between people who love each other--is a tremendous gift to Beck, her family, and all who have the honor of knowing him. <i>--Ericka Lutz</i></p>s you'll never be hurt as much by being open as you have been by remaining closed."<br><br>The messenger is a school janitor with a master's in art history who claims to be channeling "from both sides of the veil."

But <em>Sisterland</em> is not a book about what it means to live with psychic powers. Rather, it&#x2019;s a deeply emotional study of two closely-linked siblings who share many similarities but ultimately choose different paths in life. Having grown up with a mild form of ESP&#x2014;what they call &#x201c;senses&#x201d;&#x2014;the twins are confronted with how to deal with their powers. One chooses to &#x201c;go straight&#x201d; and become a suburban housewife and mother, while the other sister drops out of college to become a medium.

If you are called on to make predictions, you need to be confident of your precision and accuracy. Now you can add to your predictive methods some exciting ideas and techniques with the book <em>Identifying Planetary Triggers</em> by Celeste Teal.</p> <p>The book is divided into three major areas. The first concerns progressed charts. The second looks at planetary returns and the third section is focused on transits. Together they form a synergy which can make your accuracy quite astounding.</p> <p>The section on transits was originally written by Dr. J. Heber Smith, the first astrology teacher to coach famed astrologer Evangeline Adams. Adams proved her accuracy as an astrologer in court and attributed much of her success to the teachings of Dr. Smith. His information is presented here, unedited and in the original late nineteenth-century style. It is claimed that a rival of Evangeline Adams paid $150 for a typewritten copy of this material. And this was at a time when a loaf of bread would cost a nickel!</p> <p>If you are a professional astrologer, or if you are a casual practitioner, this book is a must. You will learn more about the art of prediction in this one book than you might have as a result of years of study and research. Filled with stories and charts to clarify what is being explained, you're going to find that <em>Identifying Planetary Triggers</em> will be an important book in understanding how to use astrology to make predictions.</p></p><p>Many astrologers focus on ways of interpreting the psychology of individuals and their relationships with the help of the stars. Now you can set yourself apart by giving a wide variety of accurate and precise predictions, thanks to Celeste Teal's <i>Identifying Planetary Triggers.</i> Teal is an associate member of the American Federation of Astrologers and has written many articles for astrological magazines. With this book you can reap the rewards of her years of research in order to be able to make giving predictions a part of your astrological practice. Even if you're not a professional, you're going to find that this book will open up new vistas of interpretation in the readings you give to yourself and others. <br> <br>Numerous techniques are given and illustrated with examples and charts so you'll understand how to use progressions, returns, and transits for making predictions. The notion of precessions, diurnals, anlunars, and more are included to add even more depth to your interpretive abilities. <br> <br>The book includes a table of the Moon's nodal positions from 1935 to 2054 so you can use the information on these nodes and their transits and aspects in any kind of chart. The book concludes with a wonderful glossary to make study easier and clearer. <br> <br>Teal writes, "I believe that in the future we will look back and find it hard to imagine a time when everyone wasn't astrologically knowledgeable. My goal is to help make forecasting simple so that one can plan more wisely." <br> <br>When you work with this book you'll see that she has succeeded. <br>Identifying Planetary Triggers was written as a companion volume to my first book, with an emphasis here on planetary returns. Individual chapters cover the Solar Return, Lunar Return, Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter and Saturn returns. This makes up the largest section of the book, while a section on progressions and another on transits makes the volume quite a thorough reference to have for forecasting. <p>Now, a book called Identifying Planetary Triggers that's almost 400 pages long could be a bit formidable unless you understand that you won't use all this information at once. No one will expect you to. </p><p>Say you or a client want to know about romance; once you determine the condition of the fifth house indicators as outlined in Part One, you'll turn right to the Venus Return chapter to interpret and make your forecast. If you have a client who's an entrepreneur, you'll use the Mars Return to guide him or her to the best time to undertake a new venture. Or, use the Mercury Return to find a risk-free time to purchase a new vehicle. For each of the returns, you're led step by step through the interpretation and shown how to find hot spots for event timing. Case histories are illustrated in each chapter so you can see the dynamics at work. </p><p>So, while you won't get through the entire book in a day, the information is there when you need it. Say Jupiter has become prominent and forming nice aspects in the progressed chart; the Jupiter Return will be instrumental in determining when the promised benefits should be expected to materialize. I can pretty much guarantee you'll learn something valuable here no matter how long you've been working with planetary returns. </p><p>Best wishes on your astrological journey, Celeste Teal</p></p><h2>Pomo Basketmaking: A Supreme Art for the Weaver</h2><p>A Supreme Art for the Weaver.

G�rtemaker delves into the startlingly neglected historical truth about Adolf Hitler&#x2019;s mistress. More than just the vapid blonde of popular clich�, Eva Braun was a capricious but uncompromising, fiercely loyal companion to Hitler; theirs was a relationship that flew in the face of the F�hrer&#x2019;s proclamations that Germany was his only bride. G�rtemaker paints a portrait of Hitler and Braun&#x2019;s life together with unnerving quotidian detail&#x2014;Braun chose the movies screened at their mountaintop retreat (propaganda, of course); he dreamed of retiring with her to Linz one day after relinquishing his leadership to a younger man&#x2014;while weaving their personal relationship throughout the fabric of one of history&#x2019;s most devastating regimes. Though Braun gradually gained an unrivaled power within Hitler&#x2019;s inner circle, her identity was kept a secret during the Third Reich, until the final days of the war. Faithful to the end, Braun committed suicide with Hitler in 1945, two days after their marriage. <br> &nbsp;<br> Through exhaustive research, newly discovered documentation, and anecdotal accounts, G�rtemaker has meticulously built a surprising portrait of Hitler&#x2019;s bourgeois existence outside of the public eye. Though Eva Braun had no role in Hitler&#x2019;s policies, she was never as banal as she was previously painted; she was privy to his thoughts, ruled life within his entourage, and held his trust. As horrifying as it is astonishing, <i>Eva Braun</i> will undoubtedly be referenced in all future accounts of this period.</p><p><b>Heike B. G�rtemaker</b>, born in 1964, is a German historian and author. She studied history, economics, and German literature in Berlin and Bloomington, Indiana. In 2005, she published a biography of Margret Boveri, a prominent German journalist from the 1930s to the 1970s. G�rtemaker lives with her husband near Berlin. She is currently working on a project dealing with the legacy of Hitler&#x2019;s inner circle in postwar Germany.1<br><br>Heinrich Hoffmann's Studio<br><br>Almost sixteen years earlier, in October 1929, Hitler and Eva Braun met for the first time in the studio of photographer Heinrich Hoffmann. Hoffmann was a press photographer and portrait photographer well known in Munich after World War I, as well as a publisher and a National Socialist from the beginning. He ran a studio, called Photohaus Hoffmann, at 25 Amalienstrasse, near Odeon Square in central Munich. From there he supplied the Munich Illustrierte Presse (Illustrated Press) and domestic and foreign agencies with his pictures. Hoffmann's father was a photographer as well, and he had apparently forced his son to follow in his footsteps; Hoffmann had owned a business of his own in Munich since 1909. Even before 1914, Heinrich Hoffmann had made a name for himself with the public and in artistic circles with his photography service-the "Hoffmann Photoreport"-as well as by taking portrait photographs. Still, he owed his flourishing business to the NSDAP. After World War I, which he spent on the French front as a reservist in a replacement detachment of the air force, he put his talents at the service of the far-right nationalist movement that was rising to power.<br><br>The Nazi Party's House Photographer<br><br>It is no longer possible to reconstruct exactly when and in what circumstances Hoffmann met Hitler for the first time. Hoffmann's daughter, Henriette von Schirach, later claimed that the Populist poet and writer Dietrich Eckart had put her father in contact with Hitler; Hoffmann himself said in his memoir that their first encounter was for purely business reasons, after an American photo agency offered him one hundred dollars for a photograph of Hitler, on October 30, 1922. As early as 1947, in an unpublished written statement in his own defense, Hoffmann claimed that the "American press" had offered him "a large sum for the first picture of Hitler" at the time. In order to get this money, "under any circumstances," he contrived a seemingly chance encounter by suggesting that Hermann Esser, a good friend of Hitler's, hold the reception for his upcoming wedding in Hoffmann's house, on July 5, 1923. In this way, he planned to meet Hitler, who was to be one of the witnesses at the ceremony.<br><br>In fact, Hoffmann had been a member of the German Workers' Party (Deutsche Arbeiterpartei, or DAP) since April 6, 1920-six months after Hitler had joined. Anton Drexler had founded the party in January of the previous year, in Munich, and it had recently changed its name to the National Socialist German Workers' Party (Nationalsozialistiche Deutsche Arbeiterpartei, or NSDAP). Hoffmann began to publish the weekly newspaper Auf gut deutsch (In Good German), edited by the radical nationalistic and anti-Semitic Dietrich Eckart, Hitler's friend, mentor, and father-figure. This failed poet used the paper to rail against the Weimar Republic, Bolshevism, and Judaism, under the motto "Germany, Awake!" There is much evidence to suggest that Hoffmann became friends with this circle of like-minded men, including Eckart, Hitler, and the journalist Hermann Esser, before he began to make himself useful to the NSDAP and especially to the man who became its leader starting on July 29, 1921: the aggressive "beer hall agitator" Adolf Hitler. Despite numerous requests, Hoffmann at first respected Hitler's wish not to be photographed. Hoffmann's first portrait of Hitler, in fact, appeared only after the failed Beer Hall Putsch of November 8-9, 1923, which made Hitler famous throughout Germany but also landed him in jail. (Hoffmann photographed him as a prisoner.) The following year, Hoffmann published a photo brochure titled (in German) "Germany's Awakening, in Words and Pictures." In 1926, the tireless Hoffmann, together with Hitler and Hermann Esser (their mutual friend and the first head of propaganda for the Party), founded a richly illustrated weekly Party newspaper, the Illustrierter Beobachter. That same year, at Hoffmann's suggestion, the V�lkischer Beobachter (The People's Observer, the Nazi newspaper) included photographs for the first time-from Hoffmann's own studio, needless to say.<br><br>The NSDAP was thus on the cutting edge, technologically speaking. Only a few years earlier it had been common practice to illustrate newspaper stories with drawings or engravings. Even The New York Times started to print photographs regularly only in 1922. Photojournalism's true breakthrough, made possible by the development of the 35 mm camera in 1925, had only just begun. Unlike in America- and also England and France, where the British Daily Mirror and French Illustration had set up a daily photographic exchange service between London and Paris as early as 1907-in Germany the practice of printing photographs in newspapers only slowly gained popularity.<br><br>Among the pictures Hoffmann published in the V�lkischer Beobachter was a series showing, for the first time, Hitler giving the Nazi salute with outstretched arm before a march of thousands of Party faithful on July 4, 1926, at the first NSDAP convention after it was reestablished in Weimar. Already, in the earliest phase of the Nazi Party's rise to power, Hoffmann was putting his initiative and photographic skill behind the power of images-and the power of the Party's not uncontroversial leader, who was controversial even within the Party at first. For Hitler and the propaganda campaign he was waging against both external opponents and opponents within the Party, Hoffmann soon made himself indispensable. He became Hitler's "personal photographer." From then on the leader of the Nazi Party almost never appeared without Hoffmann, whether on trips, on the campaign trail, or at lunch at Hitler's local Munich pub.<br><br>Hoffmann's decision to devote his career entirely to Hitler and the NSDAP paid off only in later years, however. In 1929, the Landtag (state parliament) campaigns and mass rallies provided Hoffmann's business with more and more assignments. These included the four-day NSDAP convention in Nuremburg on August 1-4, with the spectacular parade of sixty thousand SA and SS members, and Hitler's appearance on October 26 in the Zirkus Krone in Munich with Alfred Hugenberg, the press tycoon and head of the German National People's Party (Deutschnationale Volkspartei, or DNVP), in connection with the proposed German referendum against the Young Plan. That same year gave the Nazi Party its first electoral victories. In the Reichstag (national parliament) election the previous year, on May 20, 1928, it looked as though the National Socialists were sinking back into insignificance-they received only 2.6 percent of the vote-but in the Landtag and municipal elections of 1929 the trend was uniformly upward.With the world economic crisis unfolding in the background, and the rise in unemployment to 3.32 million people in Germany, the NSDAP achieved gains in Saxony, Baden, and Bavaria; in Thuringia, in fact, its vote tally rose from 4.6 to 11.3 percent.<br><br>In light of these results, it is no accident that Hoffmann, then forty-four years old, was able to expand his business even in fall 1929, at the onset of the worldwide economic crash. He profited both from the increasing number of assignments from the Party and from the greater use Hitler himself made of him. Photo agencies were booming in any case, since by that time more and more newspapers were illustrating their reports with photographs. The demand throughout the world for news photographs was constantly on the rise, and a flourishing business grew from Hoffmann's small workshop in a courtyard behind 50 Schellingstrasse. It moved to 25 Amalienstrasse in September 1929, and was renamed the NSDAP-Photohaus Hoffmann. Shortly before the reopening, Hoffmann hired new employees, and one of them was the seventeen-year-old Eva Braun.<br><br>"Herr Wolf"<br><br>Eva Braun's job at Photohaus Hoffmann seems to have been primarily behind the counter. In any case, the various statements about her actual duties are contradictory. For example, Henriette von Schirach-<br><br>Hoffmann's daughter and a friend of Eva Braun's the same age as she, who was thus in a position to know-says at one point in her memoir that Braun was an "apprentice in [Hoffmann's] photo lab," but mentions elsewhere that Braun sold "roll films" in her father's "photo store." In fact, both were true. Eva Braun, Heinrich Hoffmann later wrote, had been a "novice and shop assistant" and worked for him "in the office, as a salesgirl, and also in the laboratory." From 1933 on, after Braun was "more established" in the business, she worked exclusively "in photography."<br><br>To be a photographer was a very respected and enviable career for a woman at the time. The field was new and modern and the idea of becoming a fashion or portrait photographer attracted many women. Eva Braun was especially interested in fashion. Her first task at Hoffmann's, though, was to learn how to use a camera and develop pictures. From the beginning, her duties included running small errands for Hoffmann and his clients and working behind the counter. Along with press photography, the rise in amateur photography offered a steadily growing market, so Photohaus Hoffmann not only took photographs but also sold photographic equipment, which was now readily available to the public. In addition, it sold pictures and postcards of its own, and Eva Braun was also responsible for those sales, according to Baldur von Schirach, Hoffmann's son-in-law and the future Youth Leader of the Nazi Party. Hoffmann's preferred motifs and images included his fellow Party members and, especially, portraits of its leader, Adolf Hitler.<br><br>Eva Braun probably met Hitler for the first time in October 1929, a few weeks after starting her job. She was apparently working late, organizing papers, when Hoffmann introduced her to one "Herr Wolf" and asked her to fetch some beer and sausages for him and his friend, and for herself as well, from a nearby restaurant. During the meal together that followed, the stranger was "devouring" her "with his eyes the whole time," and he later offered her "a lift in his Mercedes." She refused. Finally, before she left the studio, Eva Braun's boss, Hoffmann, asked her: "Haven't you guessed who that gentleman is; don't you ever look at our photos?" After she said no, Hoffmann said: "It's Hitler! Adolf Hitler."<br><br>This account appears in the first published biography of Eva Braun, from 1968, by the Turkish-American journalist whose birth name was Nerin Emrullah G�n. According to G�n, Eva Braun told one of her sisters-presumably Ilse, the oldest of the three sisters-about this first meeting with Hitler, which occurred "on one of the first Fridays in October," either October 4 or October 11, 1929. But how reliable is G�n? His work is quoted extensively even today, and it tends to give the impression that Eva Braun dictated her story directly to him. From whom did he get his information, and how? And what are we to make of his own thoroughly enigmatic history?<br><br>G�n worked in the press department of the Turkish embassy in Budapest during World War II. Shortly before the end of the war, on April 12, 1945, the secret police ordered his arrest for allegedly being an enemy of the German state; he was sent to the Dachau concentration camp. Two weeks later, on April 29, 1945, he was liberated along with the other prisoners by the American Seventh Army. G�n moved to the United States, simplified his name to Gun, and later wrote a book about the assassination of John F. Kennedy. That was presumably why the CIA suspected him, as a member of the Communist Party, of being involved himself in the assassination of President Kennedy and charged him with having committed espionage and falsified documents in Europe.<br><br>In the mid-1960s, on the occasion of the anniversary celebration of the liberation of Dachau, Gun visited West Germany. That was apparently when he arranged to meet Eva Braun's family and other former members of Hitler's inner circle. He tracked down Franziska Braun, Eva's mother, in her house in Ruhpolding, Bavaria, and also questioned Eva's sisters, Ilse and Margarete (who was called Gretl), as well as Eva's best friend, Herta Schneider (n�e Ostermayr). Gun obtained access to Eva Braun's private photographs and letters, and these were published for the first time in his book. However, Gun does not give precise details about the sources of his information, and he switches freely back and forth between invented anecdotes and factual testimony from actual witnesses in a way that makes it impossible for the reader to determine which is which.<br><br>Ilse Hess, Rudolf Hess's wife, wrote in a letter to Albert Speer on June 25, 1968, that Gun, "the author of the book about Everl [her nickname for Eva Braun]," had stayed with her, Ilse Hess, "for weeks" in Hindelang, since he was now planning to write a biography of her husband; she wrote that she now called him only by the name "Mr. I pay all" (in English), since that was his "favorite expression." This remark shows the lack of respect she had for him; Gun apparently had little background knowledge and Ilse Hess did not take him seriously. Presumably, Gun likewise stayed with the Braun family the year before while he was researching his book on Eva Braun, although there is no concrete evidence either way.<br><br>Thus we cannot say that the sequence of events at the first meeting between Eva Braun and Hitler has been established with certainty, even if matters may well have played out the way Gun describes. It is certainly unclear why Hoffmann would have introduced his prominent friend and Party colleague under the fake name "Wolf." (Hitler did often use that name for himself, especially when traveling.) Possibly Hoffmann was trying to forestall a nervous, or even hysterical, reaction from the young woman. In any case, nothing could stop the attraction that apparently sprang up spontaneously on both sides. From then on, Hitler, already forty years old, remembered himself to the seventeen-year-old Eva Braun with compliments and little gifts every time he visited the studio.<br><br>Such visits were not at all difficult for Hitler to arrange. Photohaus Hoffmann, on the corner of Amalienstrasse and Theresienstrasse, was directly across the street from Caf� Stephanie, a favorite spot for the leading Nazi politicians. Before World War I, it had been a meeting point for the bohemians of the Schwabing district, including such figures as Heinrich Mann, Erich M�hsam, Eduard Graf von Keyserling, and Paul Klee. The Party's headquarters were just a side street away, at 50 Schellingstrasse, the same street where the editorial and printing offices of the V�lkischer Beobachter were located a few houses farther on. At 50 Schellingstrasse itself was the building where Heinrich Hoffmann and his family used to live, and Hoffmann's "workshop" was located next door. That was where he photographed Hitler, G�ring, and other Party leaders. Also on Schellingstrasse was the Osteria Bavaria, the oldest Italian restaurant in Munich, where Hitler and his fellow Party members often used to go; it is still there today, under the name Osteria Italiana. Henriette von Schirach described the restaurant as a "cool, small winery with a little courtyard painted in Pompeian red and a 'temple,' that is, an alcove with two columns in front of it," which was kept reserved for Hitler. However, Hitler's later secretary, Traudl Junge, said that the Nazi leader's regular table was the "least comfortable table all the way in the back, in the corner."</p><h2>Black Widow 2: No More Secrets</h2><p>Now that Natasha knows the Weeping Lion's secret, she's in control of his very particular skills.

These symptoms never appear alone and are treatable and avoidable. Here, an expert in child neurology approaches learning difficulties of childhood including dyslexia, ADD, OCD, ADHD, dyspraxia and Tourette&#x2019;s syndrome from a truly groundbreaking perspective. All human babies are born prematurely and develop special, new brain cells four months after birth. Every human&#x2019;s development in the womb and particularly in these early stages of life can, therefore, be affected by developmental delay, which can blight childhood and marginalize a child at school. Since our brains continue to grow, however, the symptoms can also be treated.&nbsp;This book&nbsp;explains the background to human developmental delay and offers advice on how to get the best assessment for your child and an explanation of what the examination must include; the effects good and bad of certain foods on the brain; exercises and computer programs that you can use to expand your child&#x2019;s neural function; and case histories of children on whom this plan has worked. In the single biggest breakthrough in the history of learning difficulties,&nbsp;this guide&nbsp;explains the cause of developmental delay syndromes using simple, easy-to-follow tips to show how to greatly reduce the risk of&nbsp;a child suffering from them, and gives advice on what can be done to treat those children that do.</p><p>Dr. Robin Pauc is a specialist in child neurology and runs his own private practice.

He writes with bite and humor of the horrors and inequalities of the so-called &#34;Good War,&#34; which he says &#34;for the United States, [was] an unintended form of eugenics, clearing the population of the dumbest, the least skilled, the least promising of all Americans.&#34; Not exactly the thoughts of a sentimentalist, but the notion that war is horrible should be eternally reinforced, and Fussell does so with a fury and skill few writers can muster.Paul Fussell, critic, essayist, and cultural commentator, has recently won the H. L. Mencken Award of the Free Press Association. Among his books are &#34;The Great War and Modem Memory, &#34; which in 1976 won both the National Book Critics Circle Award and the National Book Award; &#34;Abroad: British Literary Traveling Between the Wars; Wartime: Understanding and Behavior in the Second World War;&#34; and, most recently, &#34;BAD or, The Dumbing of America.&#34; His essays have been collected in &#34;The Boy Scout Handbook and Other Observations&#34; and &#34;Thank God for the Atom Bomb and Other Essays.&#34; He lives in Philadelphia, where he teaches English at the University of Pennsylvania.</p><h2>Cyteen: The Betrayal</h2><p>After Dr. Ariane Emory is assassinated on Cyteen Station, her followers attempt to use the planet&#39;s labs to re-create Ariane</p><p>The first part of C.J. Cherryh&#39;s award-winning triad introduces the planet and complex politics of Cyteen, part of the Alliance/Union universe. Resources are limited and the scientific compound of Reseune, which produces computer-trained clones called azis, is a major power center. Reseune&#39;s lead scientist, the fierce and cruel Dr. Ariane Emory, has dominated Cyteen&#39;s political scene for decades. When she is assassinated, Reseune officials railroad a suspect and then experiment by creating a personal duplicate of Ariane. The bad news is, a clone isn&#39;t good enough. They want to recreate Dr. Emory&#39;s mind as well, and devise an artificial life for the little Ariane who&#39;ll be raised just like the original.</p><h2>Who Votes? (Yale Fastback Series)</h2><p>Elections are at the heart of the American political system, but in 1976 only 54 percent of the voting age population went to the polls. The question of who votes matters greatly to everyone involved in politics and to all those concerned about the current and future state of American democracy. Based on data from the 1972 and 1974 Census Bureau surveys, Wolfinger and Rosenstone are able to identify for the first time those social and economic groups that are most likely to vote and to explain sensibly and convincingly those factors that influence voter turnout.</p><p>Represents a major contribution to the literature dealing with voting behavior in the United States...Combines the strong analytical skills of two scholars with a unique and revealing data set. The result is a sophisticated, highly quantitative, but most readable assessment of the sociological, motivational, and political factors that account for variation in electoral participation.</p><h2>Fearless on Everest</h2><p><br><br>* Includes never-before-published letters and photographs <br><br>* Written by an Irvine family member<br>Mallory and Irvine. These two names have been inextricably joined since the two climbers disappeared on Mount Everest more than 75 years ago. Could they have been the first to reach the summit of the world's highest mountains-some 30 years earlier than Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay?<br>Mallory's story has been well chronicled, but Irvine has always been overshadowed by his more famous climbing partner and little has been written about him. Who was he? Why was he invited by the British Everest Committee to join the 1924 expedition despite his limited mountaineering experience? And why did Mallory, 16 years his senior, select Irvine as his partner for the final assault on the summit?<br>Julie Summers, great niece of Sandy Irvine, has been fascinated since childhood by the story of Uncle Sandy. In May 2000, Julie made an astonishing discovery: a long forgotten and unopened trunk containing Irvine's letters and photographs from Everest.

They grow vegetables, they tend chickens, they make chocolate. And they sing. Ironically, for a community that has taken a vow of silence, the monks have become world-famous for their glorious voices, raised in ancient chants whose effect on both singer and listener is so profound it is known as &#34;the beautiful mystery.&#34; But when the renowned choir director is murdered, the lock on the monastery&#39;s massive wooden door is drawn back to admit Chief Inspector Armand Gamache and Jean-Guy Beauvoir of the Surete du Quebec. There they discover disquiet beneath the silence, discord in the apparent harmony. One of the brothers, in this life of prayer and contemplation, has been contemplating murder. As the peace of the monastery crumbles, Gamache is forced to confront some of his own demons, as well as those roaming the remote corridors. Before finding the killer, before restoring peace, the Chief must first consider the divine, the human, and the cracks in between.</p><p><p>LOUISE PENNY is "The" "New York Times "and" Globe and Mail "bestselling author of eight Chief Inspector Armand Gamache novels.

She lives in a small village south of Montreal.</p>THE BEAUTIFUL MYSTERY (Chapter 1)<p>As the last note of the chant escaped the Blessed Chapel a great silence fell, and with it came an even greater disquiet.</p><p>The silence stretched on. And on.</p><p>These were men used to silence, but this seemed extreme, even to them.</p><p>And still they stood in their long black robes and white tops, motionless.</p><p>Waiting.</p><p>These were men also used to waiting. But this too seemed extreme.</p><p>The less disciplined among them stole glances at the tall, slim, elderly man who had been the last to file in and would be the first to leave.</p><p>Dom Philippe kept his eyes closed. Where once this was a moment of profound peace, a private moment with his private God, when Vigils had ended and before he signaled for the Angelus, now it was simply escape.</p><p>He closed his eyes because he didn&#x2019;t want to see.</p><p>Besides, he knew what was there. What was always there. What had been there for hundreds of years before he arrived and would, God willing, be there for centuries after he was buried in the cemetery. Two rows of men across from him, in black robes with white hoods, a simple rope tied at their waists.</p><p>And beside him to his right, two more rows of men.</p><p>They were facing each other across the stone floor of the chapel, like ancient battle lines.</p><p>No, he told his weary mind. No. I mustn&#x2019;t think of this as a battle, or a war. Just opposing points of view. Expressed in a healthy community.</p><p>Then why was he so reluctant to open his eyes? To get the day going?</p><p>To signal the great bells that would ring the Angelus to the forests and birds and lakes and fish. And the monks. To the angels and all the saints. And God.</p><p>A throat cleared.</p><p>In the great silence it sounded like a bomb. And to the abbot&#x2019;s ears it sounded like what it was.</p><p>A challenge.</p><p>With an effort he continued to keep his eyes closed. He remained still, and quiet. But there was no peace anymore. Now there was only turmoil, inside and out. He could feel it, vibrating from and between the two rows of waiting men.</p><p>He could feel it vibrating within him.</p><p>Dom Philippe counted to one hundred. Slowly. Then opening his blue eyes, he stared directly across the chapel, to the short, round man who stood with his eyes open, his hands folded on his stomach, a small smile on his endlessly patient face.</p><p>The abbot&#x2019;s eyes narrowed slightly, in a glare, then he recovered and raising his slim right hand, he signaled. And the bells began.</p><p>The perfect, round, rich toll left the bell tower and took off into the early morning darkness. It skimmed over the clear lake, the forests, the rolling hills. To be heard by all sorts of creatures.</p><p>And twenty-four men, in a remote monastery in Qu�bec.</p><p>A clarion call. Their day had begun.</p><p>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p><p>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re not serious,&#x201d; laughed Jean-Guy Beauvoir.</p><p>&#x201c;I am,&#x201d; nodded Annie. &#x201c;I swear to God it&#x2019;s the truth.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Are you telling me,&#x201d; he picked up another piece of maple-cured bacon from the platter, &#x201c;that your father gave your mother a bathmat as a gift when they first started dating?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;No, no. That would be ridiculous.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Sure would,&#x201d; he agreed and ate the bacon in two big bites. In the background an old Beau Dommage album was playing. &#x201c;La complainte du phoque en Alaska.&#x201d; About a lonely seal whose love had disappeared. Beauvoir hummed quietly to the familiar tune.</p><p>&#x201c;He gave it to my grandmother the first time they met, as a hostess gift, thanking her for inviting him to dinner.&#x201d;</p><p>Beauvoir laughed. &#x201c;He never told me that,&#x201d; he finally managed.</p><p>&#x201c;Well, Dad doesn&#x2019;t exactly mention it in polite conversation. Poor Mom. Felt she had to marry him. After all, who else would have him?&#x201d;</p><p>Beauvoir laughed again. &#x201c;So I guess the bar is set pretty low. I could hardly give you a worse gift.&#x201d;</p><p>He reached down beside the table in the sunny kitchen. They&#x2019;d made breakfast together that Saturday morning. A platter of bacon and scrambled eggs with melted Brie sat on the small pine table. He&#x2019;d thrown on a sweater this early autumn day and gone around the corner from Annie&#x2019;s apartment to the bakery on rue St-Denis for croissants and pain au chocolat. Then Jean-Guy had wandered in and out of the local shops, picking up a couple of caf�s, the Montr�al weekend papers, and something else.</p><p>&#x201c;What&#x2019;ve you got there?&#x201d; Annie Gamache asked, leaning across the table. The cat leapt to the ground and found a spot on the floor where the sun hit.</p><p>&#x201c;Nothing,&#x201d; he grinned. &#x201c;Just a little je ne sais quoi I saw, and thought of you.&#x201d;</p><p>Beauvoir lifted it into plain sight.</p><p>&#x201c;You asshole,&#x201d; Annie said, and laughed. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s a toilet plunger.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;With a bow on it,&#x201d; said Beauvoir. &#x201c;Just for you, ma ch�re. We&#x2019;ve been together for three months. Happy anniversary.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Of course, the toilet plunger anniversary. And I got you nothing.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I forgive you,&#x201d; he said.</p><p>Annie took the plunger. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll think of you every time I use it. Though I think you&#x2019;ll be the one using it most of the time. You are full of it, after all.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Too kind,&#x201d; said Beauvoir, ducking his head in a small bow.</p><p>She thrust the plunger forward, gently prodding him with the red rubber suction cup as though it was a rapier and she the swordsman.</p><p>Beauvoir smiled and took a sip of his rich, aromatic caf�. So like Annie. Where other women might have pretended the ridiculous plunger was a wand, she pretended it was a sword.</p><p>Of course, Jean-Guy realized, he would never have given a toilet plunger to any other woman. Only Annie.</p><p>&#x201c;You lied to me,&#x201d; she said, sitting back down. &#x201c;Dad obviously told you about the bathmat.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;He did,&#x201d; admitted Beauvoir. &#x201c;We were in Gasp�, in a poacher&#x2019;s cabin, searching for evidence when your father opened a closet and found not one but two brand-new bathmats, still in their wrapping.&#x201d;</p><p>As he spoke he looked at Annie. Her eyes never left him, barely blinked. She took in every word, every gesture, every inflection. Enid, his ex-wife, had also listened. But there was always an edge of desperation about it, a demand. As though he owed her. As though she was dying and he was the medicine.</p><p>Enid left him drained, and yet still feeling inadequate.</p><p>But Annie was gentler. More generous.</p><p>Like her father, she listened carefully and quietly.</p><p>With Enid he never talked about his work, and she never asked. With Annie he told her everything.</p><p>Now, while putting strawberry confiture on the warm croissant, he told her about the poacher&#x2019;s cabin, about the case, the savage murder of a family. He told her what they found, how they felt, and who they arrested.</p><p>&#x201c;The bathmats turned out to be the key pieces of evidence,&#x201d; said Beauvoir, lifting the croissant to his mouth. &#x201c;Though it took us a long time to figure it out.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Is that when Dad told you about his own sad history with bathmats?&#x201d;</p><p>Beauvoir nodded and chewed and saw the Chief Inspector in the dim cabin. Whispering the story. They weren&#x2019;t sure when the poacher would return, and they didn&#x2019;t want to be caught there. They had a search warrant, but they didn&#x2019;t want him to know that. So as the two homicide investigators deftly searched, Chief Inspector Gamache had told Beauvoir about the bathmat. Of showing up for one of the most important meals of his life, desperate to impress the parents of the woman he&#x2019;d fallen hopelessly in love with. And somehow deciding a bathmat was the perfect hostess gift.</p><p>&#x201c;How could you have thought that, sir?&#x201d; Beauvoir had whispered, glancing out the cracked and cobwebbed window, hoping not to see the shabby poacher returning with his kill.</p><p>&#x201c;Well, now,&#x201d; Gamache had paused, obviously trying to recall his own thinking. &#x201c;Madame Gamache often asks the same question. Her mother never tired of asking either. Her father, on the other hand, decided I was an imbecile and never mentioned it again. That was worse. When they died we found the bathmat in their linen closet, still in its plastic wrapping, with the card attached.&#x201d;</p><p>Beauvoir stopped talking and looked across at Annie. Her hair was still damp from the shower they&#x2019;d shared. She smelled fresh and clean. Like a citron grove in the warm sunshine. No makeup. She wore warm slippers and loose, comfortable clothing. Annie was aware of fashion, and happy to be fashionable. But happier to be comfortable.</p><p>She was not slim. She was not a stunning beauty. Annie Gamache was none of the things he&#x2019;d always found attractive in a woman. But Annie knew something most people never learn. She knew how great it was to be alive.</p><p>It had taken him almost forty years, but Jean-Guy Beauvoir finally understood it too. And knew now there was no greater beauty.</p><p>Annie was approaching thirty now. She&#x2019;d been a gawky teenager when they&#x2019;d first met. When the Chief Inspector had brought Beauvoir into his homicide division at the S�ret� du Qu�bec. Of the hundreds of agents and inspectors under the Chief&#x2019;s command, he&#x2019;d chosen this young, brash agent no one else had wanted as his second in command.</p><p>Had made him part of the team, and eventually, over the years, part of the family.</p><p>Though even the Chief Inspector had no idea how much a part of the family Beauvoir had become.</p><p>&#x201c;Well,&#x201d; said Annie with a wry smile, &#x201c;now we have our own bathroom story to baffle our children with. When we die they&#x2019;ll find this, and wonder.&#x201d;</p><p>She held up the plunger, with its cheery red bow.</p></p><h2>Southern Living Slow Cooker Cookbook</h2><p>123 Luscious recipes to come home to created especially for Southern Living At Home.</p><p></p><h2>FDR and the American Crisis</h2><p><b>The definitive biography of president Franklin Delano Roosevelt for young adult readers, from National Book Award finalist Albert Marrin, is a must-have for anyone searching for President's Day reading.</b><br> &nbsp;<br> Brought up in a privileged family, Franklin Delano Roosevelt had every opportunity in front of him.

After all, he had many advantages that other boys did not have.<br><br> --Sara Roosevelt, My Boy Franklin (1933)<br> A Privileged Childhood<br><br> Hyde Park, the Roosevelt estate, is in walking distance of the village of Hyde Park. Located in Dutchess County, on the east bank of the Hudson River, the village lies seventy-five miles north of New York City. On the evening of January 30, 1882, James Roosevelt sat at his desk in the library of his estate overlooking the river. On this bitter cold night, snow lay deep on the ground, and ice floes in the river sparkled in the moonlight like flecks of silver.<br><br> At once happy and relieved, James reached for a steel-nibbed pen as he opened his wife Sara&#x2019;s diary. Turning to a fresh page, he wrote, &#x201c;At quarter to nine my Sallie had a splendid large boy, but was unconscious when he was born. Baby weighs ten pounds without clothes.&#x201d;<br><br> It was a close call, as mother and child nearly died. Sara had gone into labor twenty-four hours earlier, but had trouble giving birth. She was in such agony that the doctor administered chloroform to knock her out. He gave too much. When her baby finally arrived, it was not breathing. Quickly, the doctor grabbed the newborn and began blowing into his mouth, forcing air into his lungs until he began to breathe normally.<br><br> A few days later, once they were sure he would live, the grateful parents named their son Franklin Delano Roosevelt. Despite his birth ordeal, baby Franklin had a sweet disposition. Sara wrote that he &#x201c;crows and laughs all the time&#x201d; and was &#x201c;always bright and happy&#x201d; and &#x201c;never cries.&#x201d;<br><br> Franklin was born into a family whose roots lay deep in American history. In 1644, Claes Martenszen van Rosenvelt and his wife, Jannetje, sailed from Holland bound for New Amsterdam, a tiny Dutch settlement at the southern tip of Manhattan Island. Van Rosenvelt means &#x201c;of the field of roses&#x201d; in Dutch, but what the name had to do with roses is a mystery. Anyhow, within twenty years of the couple&#x2019;s arrival, an English army under the Duke of York seized New Amsterdam. Overjoyed at the easy victory, His Grace renamed the colony New York in his own honor.<br><br> Claes was a practical man, more interested in making his fortune than battlefield heroics. Frugal and hardworking, he accumulated land, buildings, and money. Over the years, his sons and grandsons chose brides from equally frugal and hardworking families. In the process, the van Rosenvelt name changed to its English form, Roosevelt.<br><br> By the mid-1700s, the family had split into two branches. Its Hudson Valley branch settled near Hyde Park; the other made its home in New York City and Oyster Bay, Long Island. Both families gained respect for their wealth, public service, and patriotism. Isaac the Patriot, a Roosevelt ancestor, was among those who ratified the Constitution in 1788. The following year, he led George Washington&#x2019;s horse in the first inaugural parade, held in New York City. In the twentieth century, both branches of the family would give America a president.<br><br> Baby Franklin&#x2019;s mother was a Delano. Sara&#x2019;s people counted themselves among the bluest of American blue bloods, their ancestors having come with the Pilgrims in 1620 aboard the Mayflower. Fiercely proud of her heritage, Sara boasted, &#x201c;My son Franklin is a Delano, not a Roosevelt at all!&#x201d; It was she who insisted on naming him Franklin Delano, after a childless uncle.<br><br> Friends said that Delano men had salt water, not blood, in their veins. Over the years, Sara&#x2019;s family had grown wealthy by hunting whales for their fat, which, when melted and burned in lamps, lit the nation&#x2019;s homes. Other Delanos owned merchant ships, trading American manufactured goods for Asian spices, silk, and tea. Warren Delano, Sara&#x2019;s father, went into a less upright, but more profitable, business. He struck it rich selling opium.<br><br> In the 1820s, China had much to sell foreigners but bought little from them in return. From the Forbidden City, the imperial palace in Beijing, the emperor declared that China already had everything worth having. Thus, Chinese people must shun the &#x201c;hairy monkey men&#x201d; and &#x201c;foreign devils,&#x201d; as they called whites. British merchants disagreed, bribing Chinese officials to allow entry of opium, a highly addictive drug produced in British-ruled India. Though the emperor banned opium in his realm, in the 1840s British forces defeated China in the first of two conflicts called the Opium Wars. Before long, millions of Chinese became slaves to a drug that enriched foreigners, filling their strongboxes with silver and China with misery.<br><br> Warren Delano had no qualms about dealing in &#x201c;black dirt,&#x201d; as Chinese people called the tarlike opium they smoked in pipes. He wrote his family: &#x201c;I do not pretend to justify . . . the opium trade [from] a moral . . . point of view, but as a merchant I insist it has been a fair, honorable and legitimate trade.&#x201d; Selling opium, he claimed, was no better or worse than selling wine and whiskey.<br><br> The American Civil War made Warren Delano richer than ever. As the conflict raged, he imported huge chests of raw opium, which he sold to the Medical Bureau of the U.S. War Department at a handsome profit. Purified opium relieved the agony of gunshot wounds and amputations, though not without ill effects. A few injections turned wounded men into addicts, creating a drug problem never before seen in America. Opium use was legal in the 1800s. Groceries sold it in syrup form, sweetened with sugar to mask the bitter taste. A few drops of this stuff put crying infants to sleep and stopped diarrhea, a common cause of infant death. Opium also eased women&#x2019;s &#x201c;monthly complaints.&#x201d; The only problem was that it created yet more addicts.</p><h2>The Unofficial Narnia Cookbook: From Turkish Delight to Gooseberry Fool-Over 150 Recipes Inspired by The Chronicles of Narnia</h2><p><p><strong>Bring the Majesty of Narnia to Your Table!</strong></p> <p>Have you ever wished you could travel through the wardrobe with Lucy, Edmund, Susan and Peter, simply to taste some of the wondrous food they eat?

Lewis</p> <p><strong>Dinah Buchloz</strong> is the author of the <em>New York Times</em> bestselling <em>Unofficial Harry Potter Cookbook</em>. She lives in Philadelphia with her husband and four children. She had never been to Narnia but plans to visit as soon as she finds the right wardrobe. </p></p><p>DINAH BUCHOLZ is the author of the wildly popular The Unofficial Harry Potter Cookbook published by Adams Media. She started out with a degree in English, went on to teach the subject, and followed that up with an editing job at a magazine publisher in Manhattan.<p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p>C. S. Lewis wrote, &#x201c;Eating and reading are two pleasures that combine admirably.&#x201d; He also said, &#x201c;You can never get a cup of tea large enough or a book long enough to suit me.&#x201d; Don&#x2019;t you just love this guy? He&#x2019;s a kindred spirit with those of us whose favorite pastimes are eating and reading. Lewis once said that he wrote a lot about food not because he thought that was what kids wanted to read about but because he just liked lots of good eating himself. Yes, you really could just love this guy. (By the way, C. S. stands for Clive Staples, so it&#x2019;s no wonder his friends called him Jack.)</p> <p>I like lots of good eating myself, and also lots of good cooking. My greatest love, though, was&#x2015;and still is&#x2015;reading good books. I was enchanted by such classics as <i>Little Women, Little House on the Prairie</i>, and <i>Five Children and It</i>. The concept of afternoon tea in these old-fashioned books captured my imagination, and I longed to revive this delightful custom. I used to daydream about having tea with my friends, with my little pinkie sticking out and eating small cookies.</p> <p>When I started reading the Harry Potter books as an adult, my fascination with the quaint, old-fashioned foods and customs that still survive today in Great Britain only increased. During the period that I was writing <i>The Unofficial Harry Potter Cookbook</i>, I discovered The Chronicles of Narnia series. Somehow this classic series had passed me by when I was little, and now my oldest daughter was reading them. I fell in love. Puddleglum the Marsh-wiggle. Trumpkin the Dwarf. Tumnus the Faun. But best of all, the food.</p> <p>Lewis wrote with obvious relish about the food his characters ate. He didn&#x2019;t leave it to his readers to imagine what Lucy had for tea with Tumnus or what the magician fed her for lunch; instead, he listed every food with loving detail. We know exactly what the Pevensies took with them on their journeys and what they foraged for on the way. We learn some good lessons in cooking from Centaurs and Fauns and even Calormenes.</p> <p>It&#x2019;s hard to pick a favorite food scene. The scenes with Puddleglum, who is absolutely certain the children will hate his food, are unforgettable. When they protest that his eel stew is delicious, he is sure then that it will disagree with them. Lasaraleen makes you want to laugh as she drives Aravis frantic over the sumptuous snacks Lasaraleen commands the slaves serve. You also can&#x2019;t help wishing you could eat some of those whipped cream and fruit jelly dishes while you&#x2019;re laughing.</p> <p>In Narnia, whenever the characters eat something, you can feel their relief, comfort, or delight. Relief, warmth, and comfort when they sit down, cold and starving, to a hot dinner in the Beavers&#x2019; home (<i>The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe</i>, chapter 7). Joy and delight at the end of their quest with a feast in Cair Paravel (<i>The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe</i>, chapter 17). Food isn&#x2019;t just something mentioned as an aside to remind us that the characters are real people. Food is almost its own character and it brings along these big emotions. When King Tirian is tied up for the night, starving, the Mice, Rabbit, and Moles bring him food, and we rejoice with him that he hasn&#x2019;t been forgotten; we&#x2019;re also moved that he still has friends willing to risk their lives to bring him sustenance (<i>The Last Battle</i>, chapter 4).</p> <p>Wouldn&#x2019;t you love to sample some of the food you&#x2019;ve read about? Doesn&#x2019;t it all sound so mouth-wateringly good? Imagine how nice it would be to sit in a cozy cave, with a fire flickering in the fireplace, and have tea with Tumnus. Few things are more pleasant than a nice chat with friends over steaming mugs of tea, washing down tender soft-boiled eggs with three kinds of toast and a sugar-dusted tea cake.</p> <p>With this book, you can stop imagining and start living. Create entire meals from your favorite scenes in Narnia by following the menu plans, which cluster together recipes from each food scene. If you want to enact the feast in Cair Paravel, you don&#x2019;t have to look up which foods were eaten at the feast and then find each recipe individually in this book. All that work has been done for you. Simply find the feast at Cair Paravel in chapter 4, and recipes for all the foods eaten there are laid out in front of you. The recipes are graded according to ease or difficulty of preparation. A grade of 1 spoon means easy, a grade of 2 spoons means middle of the road, and a grade of 3 spoons means difficult. So you can decide what kind of challenge you&#x2019;re up for before entering the kitchen.</p> <p>Best wishes for good cooking and happy eating!</p> <p><b>SOME CAVEATS: MOMS AND DADS TAKE NOTE!</b></p> <p>In this book I aimed to produce recipes for every single food reference I could glean from The Chronicles of Narnia. To remain true to the series, I included recipes for foods that you, the parents, may feel are not appropriate for children to prepare, either because the technique is too complex or the method too dangerous, or because the ingredients contain alcohol. Please use your discretion in allowing your children to create or sample them. I&#x2019;ve included them for adult fans to enjoy.</p> <p>The two main concerns you might have pertain to ingredients and method. Some recipes specify alcoholic ingredients. Where possible, I suggest substitutions. Where no substitutions are available, you decide whether a particular recipe has too much for your child to consume. Please note that many of the recipes require long cooking times, which will decrease the alcohol content. Some of the menus suggest wine or beer as an accompaniment because C. S. Lewis listed it as part of the meal. In such cases I&#x2019;ve included substitutions for kids. Also, some of the beverages call for coffee. If you are concerned about your child drinking coffee, you can use decaf as an alternative.</p> <p>Some of the methods in the recipe preparation are dangerous. Children should not attempt any recipes that require boiling sugar or deep frying. Instead they can beg you&#x2015;and I back them!&#x2015;to prepare these recipes for them. Young teens can cook with these techniques under close adult supervision at their parents&#x2019; discretion.</p> <p>I don&#x2019;t think I need to caution you about supervising children handling knives or working near the stove top and a hot oven, but my editor thinks I do, so I have to put that in. Having said that, I wish you fun in the kitchen and happy eating!</p></p><h2>Jamie Does...</h2><p>Jamie Does... is Jamie's Oliver personal celebration of amazing food from six very different countries. <br><br>Cheap, short-haul flights and long weekend getaways have become increasingly popular and within a few short hours of the UK there are new and exciting worlds of food waiting to be discovered as Jamie finds out. <br><br>Each chapter focusses on a different city or region - Marrakesh, Athens, Venice, Andalucia, Stockholm and the Midi Pyrenees region of France.

The Spirit's exploits, which started as comic-book inserts for Sunday newspapers, have been reprinted before but never as lavishly as now. It is treatment they richly deserve, and DC Comics plans to faithfully reproduce their entire run of more than 10 years in full color and hard covers. The stories from 1940 featured in the inaugural volume are relatively primitive, but already evident are Eisner's hallmarks: layouts influenced by German expressionist film composition (and presaging film noir, which would emerge in the mid-'40s), moody drawings drenched in atmospheric black ink, subject matter culled from outside genre conventions, and unwillingness to treat the figure of a do-gooder in a domino mask with a straight face. The stories slated for future volumes are among the most accomplished and memorable ever done for comics, but even this premiere collection constitutes an ideal introduction to Eisner. <i>Gordon Flagg</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

Nearly 2,500 years ago, in 480BC, at a bleak pass in a far-flung corner of eastern Greece, three hundred Spartan warriors faced the army of Xerxes of Persia, a massive force rumoured to be over a million strong. Their orders were simple: to delay the enemy for as long as possible while the main Greek armies mobilized. For six days the Spartans held the invaders at bay. In the final hours - their shields broken, swords and spears shattered - they fought with their bare hands before being overwhelmed. It was battle that would become synonymous with extraordinary courage, heroism and self-sacrifice: it was Thermopylae. In Gates of Fire, Steven Pressfield tells the epic story of those legendary Spartans: the men and women who helped shaped our history and have themselves become as immortal as their gods.</p><p><i>Go tell the Spartans, stranger passing by, that here obedient to their laws we lie.</i><p> Thus reads an ancient stone at Thermopylae in northern Greece, the site of one of the world's greatest battles for freedom. Here, in 480 B.C., on a narrow mountain pass above the crystalline Aegean, 300 Spartan knights and their allies faced the massive forces of Xerxes, King of Persia. From the start, there was no question but that the Spartans would perish. In <i>Gates of Fire</i>, however, Steven Pressfield makes their courageous defense--and eventual extinction--unbearably suspenseful.</p><p> In the tradition of Mary Renault, this historical novel unfolds in flashback. Xeo, the sole Spartan survivor of Thermopylae, has been captured by the Persians, and Xerxes himself presses his young captive to reveal how his tiny cohort kept more than 100,000 Persians at bay for a week. Xeo, however, begins at the beginning, when his childhood home in northern Greece was overrun and he escaped to Sparta. There he is drafted into the elite Spartan guard and rigorously schooled in the art of war--an education brutal enough to destroy half the students, but (oddly enough) not without humor: "The more miserable the conditions, the more convulsing the jokes became, or at least that's how it seems," Xeo recalls. His companions in arms are Alexandros, a gentle boy who turns out to be the most courageous of all, and Rooster, an angry, half-Messenian youth. </p><p> Pressfield's descriptions of war are breathtaking in their immediacy. They are also meticulously assembled out of physical detail and crisp, uncluttered metaphor: </p><blockquote> The forerank of the enemy collapsed immediately as the first shock hit it; the body-length shields seemed to implode rearward, their anchoring spikes rooted slinging from the earth like tent pins in a gale. The forerank archers were literally bowled off their feet, their wall-like shields caving in upon them like fortress redoubts under the assault of the ram.... The valor of the individual Medes was beyond question, but their light hacking blades were harmless as toys; against the massed wall of Spartan armor, they might as well have been defending themselves with reeds or fennel stalks. </blockquote> Alas, even this human barrier was bound to collapse, as we knew all along it would. "War is work, not mystery," Xeo laments. But Pressfield's epic seems to make the opposite argument: courage on this scale is not merely inspiring but ultimately mysterious. <i>--Marianne Painter</i>"In <i>Gates of Fire,</i> Steven Pressfield brings the battle of Thermopylae to brilliant life, and he does for that war what Charles Frazier did for the Civil War in <i>Cold Mountain.</i> When you finish Pressfield's work, you will feel you have fought side by side with the Spartans.

Chocolate lovers in Seattle immediately beat a path to Madison Street to taste desserts as wonderful as anything in Paris or Belgium. Over the past two decades, Fran Bigelow has grown into a world-class chocolatier, operating two elegant shops that enjoy cult status in Seattle and beyond, by way of her mail-order and Internet business. <br><br>Now, in her debut cookbook, Fran reveals the magic behind her addictive creations: how she manipulates a few ingredients&#x2014;butter, cream, eggs, sugar, salt, vanilla, and nuts&#x2014;to create sublime textures and highlight pure flavors in her elegant modern desserts. The seventy-five recipes included here range from extravagant celebration cakes and holiday specialties (White Chocolate Torte or Souffl�d Chocolate Mocha Roll); to European style fruit and nut tarts (Chocolate Cherry Tart or Milk Chocolate Cr�me Fra�che Tart), souffl�s, cheesecakes (White Chocolate Brie Cheesecake, a Fran specialty), homemade ice creams (Dark Chocolate and Ginger Bombe), and extraordinary renditions of American classics, including brownies, chocolate cookies, the ultimate hot fudge sauce, and a chocolate milkshake that will instantly transport you back to childhood. <br><br>Fran also tells you everything you need to know about chocolate, from the different styles of chocolate-making employed in Europe, South America, and the U.S. (and how each result in different flavors), to deciphering labels (which ingredients enhance meltability, for example), and how the amount of cocoa in different brands and styles of chocolate influences the final taste of a dessert. You will learn how to taste a truffle&#x2014;preferably in two bites&#x2014;and the language of chocolate &#x201c;signs,&#x201d; the squiggles atop candies. Recipes for some of Fran&#x2019;s award-winning confections are also included here: chocolate cherries and nut clusters; chocolate stuffed fruits; easy cocoa-dusted truffles; and more ambitious dipped truffles featuring liqueurs, coffee, vanilla, and other chocolate-friendly ingredients; and chocolate fondue, a perfect party dessert for children and adults alike. <br><br>Whether you are a cocoa connoisseur or devotee of the cacao bean with cravings that won&#x2019;t quit, <i>Pure Chocolate</i> is a must-have for any chocolate aficionado.</p></p><p>A history of chocolate in Seattle predated the opening of Fran's some 20 years ago. But Fran Bigelow single-handedly altered the entire landscape. She had meant to open a pastry shop and discovered that truffles were among the deep dark concerns of Seattle residents. Her Gold Bar became a gold standard for adult candy bars, in Seattle and then across the nation. Fran Bigelow would never claim the renown she so deserves, but would instead most likely spread the credit around like a chocolate butter glaze on one of her earth shattering cakes. But the proof is in the pudding and the pudding--called Princess Pudding--can be found on page 140 of <i>Pure Chocolate</i>, Fran Bigleow's distillation of all she knows. She holds nothing back. She shares freely, confidently.<p> "If you are patient and understand its unique properties," Bigelow says in her introduction, Everything You Need to Know About Chocolate, "chocolate will repay you with the most perfect pleasure." Can you imagine? Perfect pleasure? Bigelow unlocks the secrets, one after another. She cautions all along, however, that patience is essential. "If you're one of those folks who thinks life is too short to stuff cherry tomatoes," Bigelow intones, "you may not have the patience for tempering chocolate." She establishes up front the basic rules of working with chocolate, then proceeds to act like best friend and coach in each and every recipe. The experienced baker and chocolatier may jump right in. For the new comer, Fran suggests those recipes that are easiest to master and act as building blocks for more complex procedures. Your results, in other words, are guaranteed.</p><p> In 10 chapters Bigelow moves from cookies and brownies (you may think you know brownies; you may want to reconsider), through tortes, tarts, cakes, cheesecakes, puddings, and custards. <i>Pure Chocolate</i> is worth its weight if only for the chapter on ice cream and sorbet. There are glorious sauces and delicious chocolate drinks. And finally, the chapter on truffles that begins with the introduction to tempering chocolate, one of the great mysteries on the kitchen.</p><p> Seattle learned 20 years ago that all it thought it knew about chocolate had to be relearned over and over again with return after return to Fran's. That this fabulous experience has been packed in between two covers and sent home to the diligent cook, well, that's Fran Bigelow right there, sharing all she knows. <i>--Schuyler Ingle</i></p><p>Fran Bigelow studied at the California Culinary Academy. Her chocolates are favorites in Seattle, where she runs two branches of Fran&#x2019;s Chocolates, and her thriving mail-order and Internet business can be found at www.franschocolates.com.

It will trap time and stop it, eliminating humanity's irritating unpredictability. This would make the Auditors, who observe the universe and enforce the rules governing it, very happy. It would also put Death out of a job, which the Grim Reaper <i>isn't</i> happy about. Fortunately, the History Monks have encountered this situation before; in fact, Lu Tze, the Sweeper, has <i>personally</i> dealt with it before.

Nick took the box that proclaimed to be easy off the shelf and put it in the carriage. "Let's hope for the best."<br><br>"If he doesn't like it, I'll tell him it was your call."<br><br>"That's good of you, babe," he said as he steered the cart toward the chicken nugget aisle. "So I've been thinking."<br><br>Sam was busy enjoying the view of his denim-clad ass as she followed him through the store. He had rich brown hair that curled at the ends, hazel eyes and a mouth that was made for sin. And he regularly made sinfully good use of it. "About?"<br><br>"We need some help."<br><br>"With what?"<br><br>"Let me rephrase&#x2014;we need someone to run our lives, especially with Scotty coming to stay with us. What if we get caught at work or something comes up that we can't get out of?"<br><br>Sam thought about that. "He could go to my dad's."<br><br>"True, but your dad and Celia have lives too. If Scotty lives with us, he's our responsibility."<br><br>"What do you think we need?"<br><br>"Someone to keep tabs on him when we're not home. To drive him to practice if we can't do it. To make sure the house isn't a wreck, the dry cleaning gets picked up, the bills get paid, there's dinner at night and some sort of schedule."<br><br>Sam rolled her shoulders, already chafing at the thought of paying someone to boss her around. "I don't know about this..."<br><br>"Someone to buy the mac 'n cheese and chicken nuggets," he added with the charming smile that made her knees go weak. "You'd never have to step foot in a grocery store again."<br><br>"That's playing dirty, Senator."<br><br>"We need someone like Shelby." The tiny dynamo had put together their fairytale wedding in six short weeks. "Someone who can hold her own with you," he added, ducking as she took a playful swing at him. "Why does it have to be a her? I'm picturing a studly dude named Sven with muscles on top of his muscles."<br><br>Over his shoulder, Nick rolled his eyes at her. "It doesn't have to be a her. It has to be someone who can put up with you."<br><br>Even though he was absolutely right about that, she'd never tell him so. "You're skating on thin ice, my friend." She followed him up one freezer aisle and down another until he stopped the cart in front of a mind-boggling selection of chicken nuggets. "I wonder if Shelby would be up for a career change."<br><br>Laughing, Nick put his arm around Sam. "We could certainly ask her."<br><br>"She won't want to do it. She has a booming business."<br><br>"You never know. It's certainly worth asking. Maybe she knows someone who'd be interested."<br><br>"We're really doing this?"<br><br>"Let's ask around and see what transpires."<br><br>"You're sure this <em>she</em> of yours will know what chicken to buy?"<br><br>Nick opened the freezer door and withdrew a bag of breast tenders, studied them and put them back. "She can't screw it up any worse than we are."<br><br>"That's for sure." Sam's cell phone rang. "Saved by the bell."<br><br>He frowned at her. Their rare day off together had taken a tremendous amount of schedule juggling to pull off, and she hoped this call wouldn't ruin their plans. They'd even declined the standing invite to Sunday dinner at the Leesburg, Virginia, home of his adopted parents, retired Senator Graham O'Connor and his wife, Laine.<br><br>Sam flipped open the phone. "Holland."<br><br>While Sam took the call, Nick studied the chicken tender options. He'd been nervous about Scotty's pending arrival for days now. The three-week visit was actually a trial run for all of them. The boy Nick had met at a campaign stop at a Virginia home for children in Richmond had become their close friend. When Nick asked him to come live with them permanently, Scotty's hesitation had surprised him. With hindsight, Nick could understand the twelve-year-old boy's reluctance to leave the place that had become home to him.<br><br>He'd been elated when Scotty mentioned a baseball camp in the District and suggested he might stay with them while he attended. Nick wanted everything to be perfect for all of them, thus the knot of fear he'd been carrying around. Nothing about their life was ever perfect. Most of the time it was a bloody circus&#x2014;literally&#x2014;with Sam hunting down murderers while he campaigned for reelection.<br><br>They were lucky to get ten uninterrupted minutes together on a regular day. What business did they have bringing a child into that madness? But what choice did they have? He'd become essential to them, and now Nick could only hope they'd become essential to him too.<br><br>"What's the matter?" Sam asked.<br><br>Nick dragged his eyes from the chicken nuggets and turned to her. "Was that work?"<br><br>She shook her head. "Tracy had another huge fight with Brooke." Sam's sister had been locked in World War III with her teenage daughter for months now. "It keeps getting worse."<br><br>"That's tough."<br><br>"Trace is a mess." She reached up to caress his face. "What has you looking so troubled?"<br><br>"I was thinking about Scotty."<br><br>"What about him?"<br><br>"What if this visit is a disaster? What if we blow our only chance with him?"<br><br>Sam stepped closer, placed her hands on his shoulders and looked up at him with potent blue eyes. "It won't be a disaster. It'll be reality. He needs to see what our life is really like&#x2014;the good, the bad, the ugly. There's no sense sugar-coating it. If he comes to live with us, he needs to know what he'd be getting. He needs to know who he'd be getting."<br><br>Amused and touched by her efforts to bolster his spirits, he said, "And who would he be getting?"<br><br>"Two people who'd love him and care for him and support him&#x2014;always."<br><br>"You're right. Of course you're right."<br><br>"I usually am," she said with a cocky grin that made him laugh.<br><br>"I refuse to dignify that with a response for fear of hearing about it for the rest of my life." Reaching into the freezer, he grabbed a bag of breast tenders and tossed it into the carriage. "Let's hope we got something he'll eat. If all else fails, there's always his favorite&#x2014;spaghetti."<br><br>"Even we can't screw that up."<br><br>"Don't jinx us."<br><br>She took his hand and linked their fingers. "It'll be great. I promise."<br><br>Since his gorgeous wife was, in fact, often right, Nick chose to believe her. For the first time in days, the knot in his stomach loosened a bit. Maybe, just maybe, it would all be fine.<br><br>After they stashed the groceries at home, Nick went looking for Sam and found her in the study in front of the computer. "Um, excuse me. Day off. Remember?"<br><br>"I need to check in, and then I'm all yours."<br><br>He wrapped his arms around her from behind and stopped short when he saw that she'd rearranged his desk&#x2014;again. "Really, Samantha? Every time?"<br><br>The kisses he placed in the most ticklish areas on her neck made her laugh even harder.<br><br>He reached around her and pushed the power button on the monitor. "You're done." With more kisses to sweeten her up, he said, "What do you think about a trip to Georgetown? I bet our workaholic buddy Shelby is at her shop today. We can stop in and say hello. If she isn't there, we can grab some lunch and do some window shopping."<br><br>She curled an arm around his neck and brought him down for a real kiss. "Am I only allowed to window shop?"<br><br>"Whatever you want, my love."<br><br>"Ohhh, I like the sound of that."<br><br>"Then let's go."<br><br>They grabbed a cab to the swanky neighborhood where Shelby kept a storefront bridal boutique. "Damn it," Sam said when she saw the closed sign outside the main door. "It was too much to hope that she'd be open today."<br><br>"Look." Nick pointed to a pink Mini Cooper parked across the street. "Who else could that belong to?"<br><br>"True."<br><br>"Call her. Maybe she'll see us."<br><br>Sam pulled out her phone and placed the call.<br><br>"Did you already blow it with the sexy senator?" Shelby asked when she answered.<br><br>"Ha-ha, no, I didn't already blow it with him," Sam said with a smile for Nick. "Thanks for the vote of confidence, though. We're outside your store. Got time for a quick visit?"<br><br>"For you? Always!"<br><br>Sam slapped the phone closed. "She's coming."<br><br>A minute later, Shelby appeared at the door to let them in. The tiny blonde, dressed in a pink silk jogging suit, greeted them with hugs and squeals of delight, though her face was puffy and red. "You guys look fabulous! Married life is clearly agreeing with you. Are you here about the replacement dress? Vera promised it by the end of the month. I still can't believe someone actually slashed a Vera Wang original!"<br><br>"What's wrong, Shelby?" Sam asked. "Have you been crying?"<br><br>"Oh no, no. Allergies." She led them back to her office. "They're a bitch this time of year."<br><br>Behind Shelby's back, Sam grimaced at Nick, letting him know she didn't believe Shelby's explanation.<br><br>When they were seated in pink leather easy chairs and holding glasses of pink lemonade, Shelby clapped her hands and let out another giddy squeal. "It's so good to see you! I'm thrilled you came by. The dress should be in any time. Unfortunately, we caught Vera in the height of the spring wedding season."<br><br>"Actually, we're not here about the dress, even though we appreciate your help in replacing it," Nick said, glancing at Sam. "We have a bit of an ulterior motive."<br><br>"What's that?" Shelby asked.<br><br>"We're hoping you might know someone who'd be interested in a job."<br><br>"What kind of job?"<br><br>"Basically, we need someone to run our lives." He explained about Scotty coming to stay with them, how they were hoping to adopt him and how they needed someone to see to the day-to-day details. "Do you know anyone who might fit the bill?"<br><br>By the time he finished speaking, Shelby had tears running down her face.<br><br>Alarmed, Sam looked at him and then at her. "Shelby, what is it?"<br><br>"I'm so sorry." Shelby tried frantically to deal with the tears. "I'm a mess lately. It's the hormones. They're making me into a wreck. And the business. I'm trying to figure out what to do, and then here you come and you're looking for&#x2014;"<br><br>"We're looking for you," Sam said, "or someone exactly like you who is ruthlessly organized."<br><br>"And can handle her," Nick said, pointing a thumb at Sam.<br><br>As Sam scowled at her husband, Shelby laughed through her tears. "I should explain. I've been trying to have a baby. I know it might seem crazy, but I'm forty-two, and I'm tired of waiting for Mr. Right to show up. I really want a baby, you know?"<br><br>Nick reached for Sam's hand and squeezed. "Yes, we know." Thinking of the baby they'd lost in February was like reopening a still-raw wound.<br><br>"I see happy couples through the most wonderful day of their lives, wishing all the time that one of those happy days might be mine. Before you dropped by, I was sitting here by myself, mired in paperwork, weeping all over the place as I wondered how much longer I can do this. I was going to have to either give up on the baby dream or give up the business, because I can't continue to work with happy people while I'm crying my eyes out all the time."<br><br>Sam sat up a little straighter. "Does that mean you might&#x2014;"<br><br>"It would be an honor and a privilege to work with you both&#x2014;and to help take care of your Scotty, who is absolutely adorable."<br><br>"Really?" Nick said. "What about your business?"<br><br>Shelby shrugged as if it were no big deal to step away from a successful business. "I have people who could run it for me. I'd keep half an eye on it from a distance."<br><br>"Are you sure about this?" Sam asked.<br><br>"Your visit here today was the sign I've been waiting for. I need a change, and working with you again would be wonderful. As long as you won't be put out by some occasional tears."<br><br>"Not at all," Nick said.<br><br>Sam nodded in agreement. "How soon could you start?"<br><br>"How about a week from Monday?"<br><br>"Wow, that'd be great," Nick said. "That's the day after Scotty gets here."<br><br>"I'll have to deal with the weekend weddings I've already committed to for a few months. I hope that's okay."<br><br>"Of course," Sam said, still not fully sold on this plan of Nick's, which had fallen into place rather easily. She also wasn't sure how she felt about being around another fertility-challenged woman when she'd had her own difficulties in that area. "One thing I should mention is the uniform."<br><br>Nick looked at Sam. "What uniform? We never talked about that."<br><br>Forcing a blank look, Sam said, "Absolutely no pink allowed. I'm afraid this is a deal breaker for me."<br><br>Nick and Shelby laughed, as Sam expected them to. "I can't believe this has happened," Shelby said with another squeal. "It's like an answer to a prayer."<br><br>"For us too," Nick said as Sam's phone rang. "Crap," she said with a regretful look for him. "It's Dispatch."<br><br>"There goes our day off," Nick said to Shelby. While Sam was occupied, he talked salary with Shelby.<br><br>In a state of shock, Sam listened to the rote recitation of details from Dispatch.<br><br>Nick glanced up at her. "What is it, babe?"<br><br>Her voice was little more than a whisper when she said, "Victoria Kavanaugh has been murdered."</p><h2>Through Paediatrics to Psycho-Analysis</h2><p>This volume includes 26 of the author's papers, covering a period of 25 years (1931-1956), which are divided into 3 sections: the emotional problems of child development, the impact of psychoanalytic concepts on pediatrics, the author's original contributions to psychoanalytic theory and practice.

Murray considered missions to be &#34;the chief end of the church.&#34; Andrew pastored churches in Bloemfontein, Worcester, Cape Town and Wellington, all in South Africa. He was a champion of the South African Revival of 1860. In 1889, he was one of the founders of the South African General Mission (SAGM), along with Martha Osborn and Spencer Walton. After Martha Osborn married George Howe, they formed the South East Africa General Mission (SEAGM) in 1891. SAGM and SEAGM merged in 1894. Because its ministry had spread into other African countries, the mission&#39;s name was changed to Africa Evangelical Fellowship (AEF) in 1965. AEF joined with SIM in 1998 and continues to this day. He died on January 18, 1917, four months before his eighty-ninth birthday. Over the years he has influenced many, including Jessie Penn-Lewis, a key figure in the 1904-1905 Welsh Revival.</p><h2>The Book of Training by Colonel Hap Thompson of Roanoke, VA, 1843: Annotated From the Library of John C. Calhoun</h2><p>Percival Everett&#x2019;s <i><b>The Book of Training by Colonel Hap Thompson of Roanoke, VA, 1843, Annotated From the Library of John C. Calhoun</b></i>, is poetry within the harsh confines of a mock historical document&#x2015;a guidebook for the American slave owner. The collection features lists of instructions for buying, training, and punishing, equations for calculating present and future profits, and handwritten annotations affirming the brutal contents. <i><b>The Book of Training</b></i> lays bare the mechanics of the peculiar institution of slavery and challenges readers to place themselves in the uncomfortable vantage point of those who have bought and enslaved human beings.</p><p><b>Percival Everett</b> is Distinguished Professor of English at the University of Southern California and the author of nearly thirty books, including <i>Percival Everett by Virgil Russell, Assumption, Erasure, I am Not Sidney Poitier,</i> and <i>Glyph.</i> He is the recipient of the Academy Award from the American Academy of Arts and Letters, the Hurston/Wright Legacy Award, the Believer Book Award, the 2006 PEN USA Center Award for Fiction, and the 2015 Guggenheim fellowship for fiction. He has fly fished in the West for over thirty years. He lives in Los Angeles.This is truly the most terrifying book I&#x2019;ve read this year. The training manual imitates the teachings of a slave master, one Colonel Hap Thompson, who, for the sake of rearing good slaves, gives methodical/technical lessons in their handling &#x2015; yes, &#x201c;handling&#x201d; is a term used for training animals. What&#x2019;s most chilling is the academic presentation, as if in good faith, teaching dehumanizing, the lowest form of human conduct. This account, were it presented any other way, would be intolerable. But Everett strikes a resonant chord by using the elevated and refined language of an educated &#x201c;trainer.&#x201d; The power is in actual reckonings &#x2015; brute force so that individuals become subhuman; and if they do not comply, subjecting them to dehumanization again and again. It&#x2019;s torture dignified by logic, philosophical beliefs, and white man&#x2019;s rhetoric.</p><h2>Hellcat Aces of World War 2 (Osprey Aircraft of the Aces No 10)</h2><p>Grumman&#39;s successor to the pugnacious Wildcat, the Hellcat embodied many of the lessons learnt by F4F pilots in the opening months of the Pacific war. Introduced to the fleet in January 1943, and blooded in combat against the Japanese by VF-5 seven months later, the F6F served as the principal US Navy fighter on board carrier decks until VJ-Day. Despite its lethality in the air when ranged against the best Japanese fighters, it still retained docile handling qualities around the carrier deck. Pilots flying the Hellcat claimed nearly 5000 kills in the Pacific, and over 350 pilots achieved ace status on the type.</p><p>Osprey&#39;s Aircraft of the Aces series combines full colour artwork, the best archival contemporary photography, and first hand accounts from aces to bring history&#39;s greatest airborne conflicts to life.Barrett Tillman is the world&#39;s most prolific US naval aviation author, having published over two-dozen titles on the World War 2 period alone.

But her students soon come to love her fresh approach; and when her dear brother goes missing in Afghanistan, and Ms. Loupe herself breaks down, they band together to support their teacher.

First, Angleberger builds on simply drawn instructions and blank practice space ("Scribble in this box you must!") for "Jedi Super-Doodlers" with step diagrams for folding finger puppet "doodle-gami"-beginning with a generic figure requiring just three folds but highlighted by a challenging Darth Paper with Annakin's face beneath a hidden pleat. Following projects range from full-size costumes made from bulletin board paper to a rocket constructed from an emptied tube of lip balm; prints created with toys and inked silly putty molds; and even advice for taking good photos of finished work. Readers will take to heart Yoda's "Doodle or doodle not!

When Mercury's playful antics fail to lift the foul mood, he resorts to trickery (which he later admits), feigning a hurt foot in order to convince Festus to take him fishing. Sure enough, the trip does the trick and the old man returns appreciating the subtle beauty of fall, ready for anything. Nordqvist's rich watercolor scenes contrast with Mercury's volatility, achieved through pen-and-ink detail. Especially creative is a pretend-fishing scene in which a striped catch materializes from the like-striped rug. Further, a subculture of wee creatures--water-skiing frogs and various unidentifiable critters who watch and mimic--cavort through the scenes, providing added visual interest. There is a great deal of text per illustration, making this a candidate for readers ready to go from picture to chapter books. However, the plot sometimes becomes too involved with Mercury's innumerable antics, causing the jaunt to the lake to be almost anticlimactic. --Claudia Cooper, Ft.

But in what sense? Challenging the reigning consensus that the Warren Court, fundamentally, was protecting minorities, Lucas A. Powe, Jr. revives the valuable tradition of looking at the Supreme Court in the wide political environment to find the Warren Court a functioning partner in Kennedy&#x2013;Johnson liberalism. Thus the Court helped to impose national liberal-elite values on groups that were outliers to that tradition: the white South, rural America, and areas of Roman Catholic dominance.<br>In a learned and lively narrative, Powe discusses over 200 significant rulings: the explosive <i>Brown</i> decision, which fundamentally challenged the Southern way of life; reapportionment (one person, one vote), which changed the political balance of American legislatures; the gradual elimination of anti-Communist domestic security programs; the reform of criminal procedures (<i>Mapp</i>, <i>Gideon</i>, <i>Miranda</i>); the ban on school-sponsored prayer; and a new law on pornography.<br>Most of these decisions date from 1962, when those who shaped the dominant ideology of the Warren Court of storied fame gained a fifth secure liberal vote. The Justices of the majority were prominent individuals, brimming with confidence, willing to help shape a revolution and see if it would last.</p><p>Lucas A. Powe, Jr. holds the Anne Green Regents Chair at the University of Texas, where he teaches in the School of Law and the Department of Government.Mr. Powe describes himself as someone who 'worshipped' the Warren Court. Even so, he portrays it impartially as the super-legislature it often resembled&#x2015;an outcome-directed body that rarely worried about constitutional theory or precedent... The court set into motion a philosophy of political activism&#x2015;heedless of constitutional doctrine&#x2015;that has become, for many judges ever since, almost a way of life. This cannot be a good thing, however much we might applaud some of the Warren court's rulings or the good intentions that lay behind them. Admirably, especially for someone still enthralled by the Warren Court, Mr. Powe seems to recognize this. (Jay P. Lefkowitz <i>Wall Street Journal</i>)<br><br>[Powe's] book would be of considerable interest to students of the judiciary even if its sole virtue were the deftness with which Powe organizes and analyzes the unusually large number of important decisions that the Supreme Court rendered during the controversial tenure of Chief Justice Earl Warren. In this respect, Powe is deserving of comparison to such eminent chroniclers of the Court's history as Henry Abraham, Alfred Kelly, and Winfred Harbison. The book's purpose, however, is as ambitious as its scope... A comprehensive (and accessible) history of the Warren Court. (Jeffrey D. Hockett <i>Jurist: Books-on-Law</i>)<br><br>An intriguing...history of the path-breaking, even revolutionary, court under Chief Justice Earl Warren in the 1950s and 1960s. Rarely for a constitutional scholar, Powe places the Warren court's most famous cases in their political context...[in] a colorful tale. The liberal Warren court's decisions on race, crime, religion, free speech and obscenity startled, delighted or outraged contemporaries and had a far-reaching impact on American politics and society. (<i>The Economist</i> 2000-10-07)<br><br>In an important book, Lucas A. Powe, Jr. argues that the familiar debate about the merits of the Warren Court is, in fact, wrong. Far from being a group of liberal judicial activists who imposed their views on an unwilling nation, Powe argues, the Warren Court was, for much of its tenure, remarkably deferential to the political branches... Powe persuasively argues that the most important decision of...[the Warren Court] can be justified as an effort to unclog, rather than to thwart, the expression of majority will. (Jeffrey Rosen <i>New Republic</i> 2000-11-06)<br><br>A thorough and enlightening [read]. (Mary Carroll <i>Booklist</i>)<br><br>Professor Powe has written a masterful book, the best on the Supreme Court in a generation. Not only will it be seen as a definitive account of the Warren Court, but it will also be viewed as a seminal work on the U.S. Supreme Court. With this work, Powe stakes a powerful claim to be seen as the heir to Robert McCloskey. Powe has written in the best tradition of works at the intersection of law, political science, and history. Decision making in the Supreme Court depends on law, attitudes, personalities, contexts, and sometimes fortune. This book demonstrates this in a way that will seem exactly right to most students of the Court. Not since Walter Murphy's classic <i>Elements of Judicial Strategy</i> have we had a book that does this so elegantly and persuasively. (H. W. Perry, author of <i>Deciding to Decide: Agenda Setting in the United States Supreme Court</i>)<br><br>Professor Powe, demonstrating total control of the legal and historical materials, illuminates how the Warren Court was deeply embedded in the culture and politics of its time, particularly the Kennedy&#x2013;Johnson liberalism of the mid and late 1960s. In doing so, he has resuscitated a neglected and valuable tradition of the institutional analysis of public law and given us a deeper understanding of what lies ahead for America in the new millennium. (Mark Yudof, University of Minnesota)<br><br>Writing accessibly, and often irreverently, Powe locates the Warren Court within the major political movements of the era and convincingly refutes the notion that the Court was a forum of principle that ignored the political world outside its marble palace. Although there will undoubtedly be other treatments of the Court, Powe's ambitious and comprehensive survey establishes a very high threshold for any future historians to meet. (Sanford Levinson, author of <i>Written in Stone: Public Monuments in Changing Societies</i>)<br><br>This book makes an important contribution to our understanding of the Warren Court. Numerous scholars have asserted that Earl Warren and his fellow justices were deeply involved in politics and mindful of changing political currents, but L.A. Powe is the first to have demonstrated detailed connections between the legal opinions issued by Warren Court justices and contemporaneous political arguments made by members of Congress and the Executive branches. <i>The Warren Court and American Politics</i> represents a skillful blending of the techniques and concerns of legal scholars and political scientists, combined in a lively, at times riveting, narrative. (G. Edward White, University of Virginia School of Law)<br><br>Finally we have a comprehensive, readable, and clear-headed history of the Warren Court. This book is not only essential but absolutely required reading for everyone interested in American constitutional history, politics, and law. (Stephen M.

From his bohemian misadventures during the 1950s in Paris to the fortune he amassed through his trashy TV company Totally Unnecessary Productions and the three women he married, he quickly proves that his memory may be slipping, but his bile isn't. He skewers feminists, politicians, the bourgeoisie, fads, social movements, and most of all himself. And when it comes to being charged with the murder of his own best friend -- caught in bed with the second Mrs. Panofsky -- Barney's version is as contradictory and slippery as real life right up to its astonishing end. </p><p> Wildly vulgar, superbly ironic, and brilliantly manic, <i>Barney's Version</i> is Mordecai Richler's comic masterpiece, the great work of a satirist at the top of his game.</p></p><p>Barney Panofsky smokes too many cigars, drinks too much whiskey, and is obsessed with two things: the Montreal Canadiens hockey team and his ex-wife Miriam. An acquaintance from his youthful years in Paris, Terry McIver, is about to publish his autobiography. In its pages he accuses Barney of an assortment of sins, including murder. It's time, Barney decides, to present the world with his own version of events. <i>Barney's Version</i> is his memoir, a rambling, digressive rant, full of revisions and factual errors (corrected in footnotes written by his son) and enough insults for everyone, particularly vegetarians and Quebec separatists. <p> But Barney does get around to telling his life story, a desperately funny but sad series of bungled relationships. His first wife, an artist and poet, commits suicide and becomes--� la Sylvia Plath--a feminist icon, and Barney is widely reviled for goading her toward death, if not actually murdering her. He marries the second Mrs. Panofsky, whom he calls a "Jewish-Canadian Princess," as an antidote to the first; it turns out to be a horrible mistake. The third, "Miriam, my heart's desire," is quite possibly his soul mate, but Barney botches this one, too. It's painful to watch him ruin everything, and even more painful to bear witness to his deteriorating memory. The mystery at the heart of Barney's story--did he or did he not kill his friend Boogie?--provides enough forward momentum to propel the reader through endless digressions, all three wives, and every one of Barney's nearly heartbreaking episodes of forgetfulness. <i>Barney's Version</i>, winner of Canada's 1997 Giller Prize, is Richler's 10th novel, and a dense, energetic, and ultimately poignant read. <i>--R. Ellis</i></p>"Contains not a page without its laugh and not a paragraph without its smile...Richler is the funniest novelist at present at work in the English language."<br>--Francis King, The Spectator<br><br>"Like Dr. Johnson at his insulting best, Barney at the top of his form is unsurpassed...Richler has written a Lear for our selfish, penny-pinching times, a Lear uncluttered by divided kingdoms and quarreling daughters.

How did they make their canoes, tipis, traps, bark lodges, and war bonnets? How did they treat women, marry, talk, and dress? How did they hunt, use the peace pipe, perform the sun dance, make magic, gather medicine, and send signals? All these <i>Hows</i> and many more are described in this book by Arthur C. Parker (Gawaso Wanneh) from his personal experience and knowledge of Indian life. Each of the 74 sections on how the Indians did something is a fascinating and revealing exposition of Indian lore including many little-known facts.<br>Before the advent of the iron ax, for example, Indians used to cut down trees with a combination of fire and stone hatchets and before iron wire came into being, they made fishhooks from the leg or wine bone of a large bird. The author explains these and many other processes in detail. If you wish, you can make your own canoe, tan buckskin, or Indian design. You will also learn the true behavior of Indians, such as: how they were not taciturn (as pictured in numerous erroneous movies) but laughed and joked much of the time; how many Indians were not nomadic hunters but settlers who got most of their food from farming; and how, in general, Indians were not savages but native Americans who had a culture of their own with an educational system and the land, a religious belief in the spirits of the other world, and a veneration of the values of courage, integrity, honor, and generosity.<br>For anyone with little or no knowledge of the American Indian, this book will be a revelation and a challenge to our modern way of life. For readers who have some acquaintance with Indian history or anthropology, this book offers a practical guide to over 70 of the crafts, methods, and activities of these first and best American naturalists. When it comes to getting closer to the land in body or in spirit, there is no better teacher than the American Indian.</p><p></p><h2>The Littles and the Big Storm (The Littles #9)</h2><p>The seventh book from the classic series is ready to grab the attention of a new generation!

Once exploited for her psychological addiction to dangerous environments, she emerged in the wake of a nuclear blast to serve up vendetta from the ocean floor. The horror she unleashed-an ancient, apocalyptic microbe called �ehemoth- has been free in the world for half a decade now, devouring the biosphere from the bottom up. North America lies in ruins beneath the thumb of an omnipotent psychopath. Digital monsters have taken Clarke's name, wreaking havoc throughout the decimated remnants of something that was once called Internet. Governments have fallen across the globe; warlords and suicide cults rise from the ashes, pledging fealty to the Meltdown Madonna. All because five years ago, Lenie Clarke had a score to settle.<br><br>But she has learned something in the meantime: she destroyed the world for a fallacy.<br><br>Now, cowering at the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean, rifters and the technoindustrial "corpses" who created them hide from a world in its death throes.

One of the novel's most fascinating aspects is its extremely inhospitable setting, under 300 atmospheres pressure at the ocean's sunless floor. Readers will also find themselves unwillingly gripped by the simultaneously flawed and ferocious characters, shaped by a social situation bleaker than anything outside John Shirley's early novels. They know they need to cooperate, so they are trying grudgingly to overcome their anger and hatred, though they've discovered that one way to deny personal guilt is to pursue revenge. They're uncomfortably believable, like us at our least generous moments. Finally, the writing is compelling, jittery, full of dark irony. But readers will need to pick up the earlier books to really appreciate this one. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

At the time he&#x2019;d groused plenty because he only had one bottom and therefore needed only one chair, but the woman wouldn&#x2019;t budge. Even after she agreed to toss in the other three chairs without charge, he had half a mind to leave the excess furniture on the shore, until his Yankee thriftiness rebelled against such waste. So he&#x2019;d turned the table upside down in his dory, lashed the chairs into position between the legs, and rowed the entire load back to the northernmost point of Heavenly Daze. <p>Now three of his four chairs were occupied, one by his own weathered behind, and the others by the slender rear ends of his grandchildren, seven-year-old Bobby and six-year-old Brittany. The children, tousle-headed and heavy-eyed with sleep, were munching on molasses cookies, one of their favorite breakfasts.</p> <p>"Grandfather," Brittany said, breaking one of the cookies with a deft snap, "don&#x2019;t you have Froot Loops? We always had Froot Loops for breakfast when we lived with Daddy." </p> <p>"We never had Froot Loops." Bobby cast his sister a reproving look. "Sometimes we had cold pizza, but most times we had nothing." </p> <p>Biting his tongue, Salt scratched his beard and watched his granddaughter. The little girl had a tendency to embroider the truth, especially when the subject had to do with her father, Salt&#x2019;s only son.</p> <p>Holding her pinkie finger aloft&#x2013;how&#x2019;d she learn to do that?&#x2013;Brittany dunked the end of her cookie into her glass of milk. "I like these cookies better than anything we had at Daddy&#x2019;s &#x2019;partment. The pizza was always cold. And we never had milk, only soda pop." </p> <p>Salt&#x2019;s heart squeezed so tight he could barely draw breath to speak, but he forced words out: "The Good Book teaches us to be grateful for whatever we have. So eat up and get dressed, kids. We have work to do today." </p> <p>Actually, he had work to do, but he believed young ones should keep themselves busy as well. These two stood in a particular need of structure and discipline. Their father had done almost nothing to teach his children. He&#x2019;d led a life of waste and drunkenness, leaving these kids to grow up on a diet of television, table scraps, and neglect. </p> <p>Bobby reached for another cookie at the same moment Brittany extended her hand. Both sets of fingers met on the edges of the last one on the plate. </p> <p>Bobby spoke first. "I want it." </p> <p>"It&#x2019;s mine!" </p> <p>"But I grabbed it before you did." </p> <p>"Did not!"</p> <p>"Did too!" </p> <p>In the ensuing tug of war, their tiny hands knocked over Bobby&#x2019;s glass. As the milk spread over the varnished tabletop, both children dropped the cookie and averted their eyes until Salt stood to reach for a dishcloth. After tossing it into the worst of the puddle, he crossed his arms and stood at the end of the table, waiting. </p> <p>Two pairs of guilty eyes eventually lifted to meet his. </p> <p>"You see what happens when you mess around?" he asked, hoping they&#x2019;d attribute the gruffness in his voice to anger instead of heartbreak. "You waste good milk that you need. You&#x2019;re both too scrawny, and now I&#x2019;ll have to go into town to get more to replace what you spilt." </p> <p>He lifted his arm, intending to reach for the dishcloth, and winced inwardly when he saw the boy flinch. </p> <p>What sort of monster had his son been? "Finish your cookies." He lowered his gaze lest they see the shimmer of wetness in his eyes. "Then go pick a book out of the stack. I want you both to read a good bit today." </p> <p>Without taking another bite, both children slipped silently from the table and moved toward the small TV stand by the fireplace. Bobby plucked Curious George from the pile of books on a shelf under the TV; Brittany picked up Betsy-Tacy and Tib. Moving like quiet little robots, they sat cross-legged in the vinyl beanbag chairs and opened their books. </p> <p>Salt shook his head as he wiped up the spilled milk. &#x2019;Twas un-natural, the way they responded to rebuke. Though the bruises had faded from their young bodies, the scars on their hearts would take longer to heal. </p> <p>By the time Salt had washed the dishes, changed out of the long-handled underwear that served as his pajamas, and pulled the quilts over the mattress on his rope bed, the children had finished their reading. Still they sat in the beanbag chairs, apparently waiting permission to move. </p> <p>"All right, then." Salt sank to the edge of the bed as he regarded them. "You&#x2019;ve done a good job of obeyin&#x2019; and readin&#x2019;. Now I must ask you to do a good job of something else." </p> <p>The children watched him, their eyes wide. </p> <p>Salt pointed toward the lighthouse door. "Alst I ask is that you don&#x2019;t go outside while I&#x2019;m gone. Stay here in the house. If anybody tries to come inside, you scoot under this bed and lay as quiet as statues until the stranger leaves." He looked from Brittany to Bobby. "Understand?" </p> <p>As one, the children nodded. </p> <p>"All right, then." Salt pressed his hands to his knees, then stood. He hated leaving them alone&#x2013;he thought the loneliness would remind them too much of the place where they&#x2019;d lived with their dad. They&#x2019;d been alone in that filthy apartment when Salt found them, as they&#x2019;d been left alone countless other days and nights while their father went out drinking.</p> <p>"Grandfather?" </p> <p>Salt looked to the girl. "Ayuh?"</p> <p>Her voice trembled. "Will you bring us some more cookies?" </p> <p>He would have brought her the world if she&#x2019;d asked for it. </p> <p>But what he said was, "If Miss Birdie has molasses cookies, I&#x2019;ll bring &#x2019;em." </p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p></p><h2>Creative Meditation and Multi-Dimensional Consciousness</h2><p>Well-loved classic about Buddhism and the pitfalls and benefits of meditation.

ZICO Coconut Water founder Mark Rampolla argues that when you choose to reach higher, you can build an incredible business, be profitable, and <i>maybe even change the world</i>.<br></b><br> In 2004, Mark Rampolla was successful by most standards. There was just one problem: He wasn&#x2019;t inspired in his job and believed he had something more to contribute to the world.<br><br> When he asked himself, "What do I have to offer that will improve the world?" Rampolla realized that his big idea was hanging right overhead. From his time living in Central America, he and his family came to love drinking coconut water, just like the locals. But no one was really selling coconut water in the United States. <br><br> So Rampolla chased a very ambitious goal: introducing coconut water to the American beverage market dominated by a few big players. He wasn&#x2019;t just starting a business; he was creating a whole new industry. ZICO Coconut Water brought a healthy beverage alternative to American consumers while also helping developing-world growers and suppliers profit from this resource. <br><br> It was a win-win-win&#x2014;good for Rampolla, his customers, and the world. So good, in fact, that in 2013 the Coca-Cola Company purchased ZICO and is scaling the brand around the globe. <br><br> Rampolla wrote <i>High-Hanging Fruit</i> for others who want to succeed because of, not in spite of, their values. This book is for people who believe that it&#x2019;s their duty to reach higher than just the bottom line to build businesses driven by passion, purpose, and integrity. Above all, it&#x2019;s a call to arms for a new generation of entrepreneurs who want to disrupt the old model and do good by doing business.&nbsp;<br><br></p></p><p><b>MARK RAMPOLLA</b> is the founder and former CEO of ZICO Beverages. Since leaving ZICO he has become an active investor and adviser to social-impact businesses in the food, beverage, and technology industries. He lectures around the world and lives in Redondo Beach, California.Chapter 1<br><br> Reach Higher<br><br> On an unusually warm and clear Saturday morning for December in San Salvador, we drove to the beach to meet friends for the day. The air was filled with that uniquely sweet Central American scent comprising notes of jasmine, bougainvillea, tropical humidity, crushed sugar cane, and burning trash. After several years living here it now smelled like home. Maura was asleep in the passenger seat. Six months into her second pregnancy she was struggling with an all-day version of morning sickness. Ciara, our eighteen-month-old, was conked out in her rear-facing car seat behind us. My work for International Paper's (IP) packaging business had taken me to Argentina and Venezuela that previous week, and I was tired myself and looking forward to catching a few z's in one of the hammocks strung between coconut trees at the little beach house that would be our refuge for the day.<br><br> As we descended from the mountains to the coastal plain, I could feel my ears pop and the temperature rise. We drove into the sleepy port town of La Libertad. Maura awakened out of her slumber and spotted a roadside vendor, saying, "Agua de coco! That's something I can drink. Can we stop?" I said sure, but reminded her that we were only ten minutes from the house. "You know Jorge will have one ready for you in five minutes and you can drink it while floating in the pool."<br><br> "Ah, that sounds perfect," Maura said. "Keep going."<br><br> I pulled up to the tall blue gate we knew well and beeped twice. Jorge, the property manager, opened the gate and ushered us in. We chatted a little and I asked him if he could get us a bunch of coconuts for the day: "Maura est� un poco enferma." He said back to me, "Qu� lastim�. Agua de coco fresca es exactamente lo que ella necesita!"<br><br> After we parked, we watched as Jorge picked one of the coconut trees to harvest. He tightened a rope between his feet, wrapped his arms and knees around the trunk, and expertly shinnied up twenty-five feet or so to the top. He pulled out a machete from the sheath strapped to his waist and hacked away at a branch. Down fell a bunch of five or six coconuts still attached together.<br><br> By the time I helped Maura from the car and took Ciara out of her seat, Jorge had hauled the coconuts to the palapa by the pool. Holding one in his hand, he used the same machete to slice the husk little by little until he breached its tender shell. I took a picture of Ciara standing, staring down, fascinated at the bunch of coconuts on the ground, while Jorge put a straw inside one and handed it to Maura. She took a long drink, thanked him, and melted into one of the lounge chairs.<br><br> Within the hour, our group of friends was sitting poolside. There was Don, the deputy director of the Peace Corps, and his wife Candy, who was an executive with Save the Children. They owned the house. Dave and Terry, who both worked at the U.S. Embassy in San Salvador, were there. Lane and Kelly and their kids, who had recently moved from El Salvador to Guatemala, were the last to arrive. Lane was country director of Catholic Relief Services (CRS) and Kelly consulted for UNICEF. I loved hanging out with this group, although their professional dedication to good works and higher callings sometimes made me wonder if I was doing enough with my life.<br><br> As we floated in the pool, we chatted about typical expatriate themes: safety, the economy, local politics, and the latest stomach illnesses. Inevitably, the conversation drifted to what we planned to do next in our lives. Expats tend to be transients, usually staying only a few years in a given job or location. Most of us had been in the country for at least two years and were all beginning to plan what came next.<br><br> Dave, we learned, was being considered for a big promotion that would take him to Colombia. Terry wanted to move to Indonesia and hoped to shift from the consular section to the economic development track. Lane and Kelly talked about their dreams to move to Ecuador or Africa and continue their work for the poor. "What's next for the Rampollas?" Terry asked.<br><br> The question was timely. We'd been living in El Salvador for almost three years, and Maura and I talked constantly about the paths we might take: what was best for our young family, our careers, and us as a couple. Maura could do her public health consulting work from anywhere, but for me, I admitted, "That's a tough one."<br><br> I told them that work at IP was going well and that I'd likely soon be running all of Latin America for my division, which made it worth staying a few more years. Then I would be ready to move on, and it looked like there might be opportunities for me in Europe or Brazil.<br><br> "So it sounds like you're on your way," Terry said.<br><br> "I guess," I said, "but . . ." I looked around at the group. "The truth is that I don't know that paper and packaging is really what I want to dedicate my life to. If I leave IP, I guess my next logical career move would be to run the Latin America operations for some big U.S. company. But I know what that job would mean: We live in Miami and I travel one hundred to two hundred days per year. And for what? So I can make a ton of money for the company, some for us, work my way up the ladder, and eventually retire and spend my days golfing? That's not what either of us want, so I'm not really sure what we're going to do."<br><br> Maura, worried that I was heading into an existential crisis, chimed in: "Mark, there's a million things you can do. And yes, many of them are more interesting and inspirational than packaging."<br><br> "Maybe it's time for me to move to the nonprofit world," I said. "Maybe I'll return to the Peace Corps and take over for Don when he retires. Or Lane, could you find me something at CRS?"<br><br> "Mark, you'd be great in nonprofit but I think you'd be frustrated. Change is incremental and slow and it can be very political," Lane said. "With your background and experience I think you can make a bigger impact in the private sector."<br><br> I thought back to my Peace Corps experience as a small business development consultant in Costa Rica. No doubt, I helped change a few lives but on a frustratingly small scale. I had always struggled with how to reconcile my belief in making a social impact with my interest in business. My dad was a nuclear physicist and my mom a counselor, artist, and teacher. Morality, spiritual purpose, social responsibility, and even war and poverty in El Salvador were regular dinner table conversations in our Italian/Irish Catholic family. My parents also practiced what they preached, taking us to swim at the all-black public pool in town, bringing an unwed teenage mother to live with us, and adopting a Bosnian refugee family from the Yugoslav wars.<br><br> In college at Marquette University, I found myself drawn to study business after meeting friends with entrepreneurial parents, intrigued by their dynamic world full of challenging opportunities to shape the future and frankly to make a lot of money. This was the era of Gordon Gekko in the movie Wall Street, and "greed is good" was the maxim of the day. I struggled with how to reconcile what appeared to be disparate worlds. On the one hand, I wanted to become a young master of the universe. On the other, I was pulled toward my family's value of social activism and a desire to give something to the world.<br><br> After the Peace Corps, I continued to wrestle with these issues in graduate school at Duke University while pursuing joint MBA and environmental management degrees. One class would focus on profit maximization and the importance of shareholder value. In the next, I'd learn how businesses could have a devastating impact on poor communities and sensitive environments. While there I met Maura, who was pursuing her master's in public health at neighboring UNC Chapel Hill, and we soon started dating. She came from a like-minded family and held similar values but also had a magnetic and near-uncontainable joie de vivre. Her enthusiasm added a whole new dimension to the equation: that of having pure fun and enjoying life.<br><br> Because Maura and I were in serious debt from grad school, we decided I would take whatever job paid well and also gave me the fastest chance to actually run a business. That turned out to be old industrial International Paper. After two years of strategy and business development in their corporate headquarters in Memphis, Tennessee, and traveling to Europe, Latin America, and Asia, I was offered an opportunity to run a business in El Salvador and we jumped at it.<br><br> Now, three years later we had "made it" by most traditional standards. We were happily married and building a family. My salary allowed us to pay down all of our debt, have a big house and a staff of three. I ran a multinational business with three hundred employees and was meeting with presidents, ambassadors, and dignitaries of various countries. I was on the fast track to the highest executive ranks of a Fortune 50 company. Maura consulted with public-health nonprofits and supported rural community projects. We dined in the finest restaurants, vacationed in exotic spots, contributed to worthy charities. I also considered myself (and believe others did, too) a good and ethical businessperson. We had it all. Or did we?<br><br> Sometimes, the closer you get to your goals, the more you realize they're not really your goals.<br><br> As I talked with our friends that day, I knew clearly that something was missing. I was beginning to see the limitations of achieving "success" in business-at least how success had been traditionally defined. I noticed many others who had achieved so-called success sacrifice their personal health and destroy relationships with friends and family or make decisions that negatively affected the lives of dozens or thousands of people. Most businesspeople I knew were passionately competitive, but very few I met could give me a compelling answer to why they were playing the game in the first place.<br><br> "Don't worry about it, amor. We'll figure it out," Maura reassured me. "Instead let's focus on the here and now. May I have another agua de coco with a little lim�n, por favor? The bebecita and I are parched. What in the world will we do without coconut water when we move back to the States someday?"<br><br> Of course, at the time, we had no idea that we were holding the literal seed of a great idea right there in our hands. I certainly had no idea I would quit my lucrative job, we would move to New York, launch Zico, and struggle for years just to survive without knowing if we had risked it all for nothing. In that moment, we couldn't have imagined that we would help to catalyze an eight-billion-dollar global industry that would revolutionize the beverage industry, contribute to the health and wellness of millions of consumers, and lead to billions of dollars of investment in developing countries and the employment of hundreds of thousands of people. We didn't know we would build a great team and engage yogis, nutritionists, celebrities, and athletes to help tell our story. And we certainly had no idea that in addition to achieving conventional success and greater financial freedom than we could have imagined, this whole process would strengthen our marriage and family, improve my health, and help us to become more spiritual and realize what was truly important in life. Yet, when I think about how it all started, my mind goes back to the memory of watching Maura, six months pregnant, drink down the water from those freshly harvested coconuts that day by the pool.<br><br> The idea was right there over our heads. We just had to reach a little higher.<br><br> My journey from Peace Corps volunteer to corporate executive to becoming an entrepreneur was fundamentally motivated and guided by the pursuit of something higher. It was about more than money, more than conventional success. We achieved those, too, but they were the low-hanging fruit. Not to say they were at all easy, but they were more obvious goals. Right there, in front of us. Fortunately, by reaching higher, we achieved so much more. Building Zico and pursuing these higher goals wasn't easy, and the path was never straight or clear. Maura and I navigated through the heart-wrenching pains of start-up mode; the all-consuming intensity of building a new brand; brutal competition; and all the physical, mental, emotional, and moral challenges that the modern business world could throw at us. Yet we survived and in fact achieved more than we ever could have dreamed, well beyond the typical entrepreneurial success story.<br><br> In that often-told story, an entrepreneur finds some brilliant way to do something ten times better, faster, or cheaper than what was on the market before. They launch a risky new business with the goal of capturing a big chunk of some huge market dominated by a corporate behemoth. They face many challenges along the way but power through with brute force and determination to capture the hearts and minds of their customers. They go on to build a hugely profitable business, take their company public, sell to a corporate buyer, or stay at the helm for a lifetime. They amass a personal fortune, buy the big house on the hill and a ranch in Montana and fill them with art and all the toys. They vacation on yachts in the French Riviera or in rural eco-lodges in Cambodia or just "hang" with their celebrity friends in the Swiss Alps. They're interviewed by Fast Company, Wired, and Fortune, and get invited to speak at TED, Aspen, Davos, or Summit Series to share their secrets to success. To "give back," they start a foundation, fund a new building for their college, support worthy causes, and commit to giving away 50 percent of their wealth before they die. What more could a modern entrepreneur want?<br><br> We often celebrate entrepreneurs who are willing to lay it all on the line for success. Yet all too often you can "win" by the conventional measures while betraying your personal values and some deep human needs like your desire to experience joy, creativity, fun, spirituality, beauty, and love on a daily basis. It's possible to cruise off into the sunset after damaging the health of your consumers, profiting unfairly from the work of employees or suppliers, burning through precious resources, leaving a wake of environmental devastation, and leading a life utterly lacking in awareness and contemplation and filled instead with an obsessive pursuit of "just a little more."</p><h2>Zero A6M</h2><p>Second Library copy- San Diego Air and Space Museum</p><p></p><h2>Mrs. Chiang&#39;s Szechwan Cookbook</h2><p>The recipes of Chiang Jung-feng, a remarkable cook met by the authors in Taiwan, represent the essence of hearty Szechwan fare and are accompanied by information on ingredients, equipment, menu planning, and the spirit of Chinese cuisine</p><p></p><h2>Anatomy of Fitness: YOGA - The Trainer&#39;s Inside Guide to your Workout</h2><p>ANATOMY OF FITNESS: YOGA includes: a comprehensive introduction to yoga; over 65 essential, step-by-step yoga poses; and a range of different yoga sequences ranging from easy to intense, including the Salutation to the Sun, so anyone can tailor a program to suit their fitness requirements. 192 pages.

D. Snodgrass was known primarily as a confessional poet and a key player in the emergence of that mode of poetry in the late 1950s and early 1960s. Snodgrass makes poetry out of the daily neuroses and everyday failures of a man&#x2014;a husband, father, and teacher. This domestic suffering occurs against a backdrop of more universal suffering which Snodgrass believes is inherent in the human experience. <i>Not for Specialists</i> includes 35 new poems complemented by the superb work he wrote in the Pulitzer Prize winning collection, <i>Heart&#x2019;s Needle</i>, along with poetry from seven other distinguished collections.</p><p><b>from &#x201c;Nocturnes&#x201d;</b></p><p><i>Seen from higher up, it makes its first move<br> in the low creekbed, the marshlands<br> down the valley, spreading across the open<br> hayfields, the hedgerows with their tops<br> still lit, laps the roadbed, flows over<br> lawns and gardens, past the house and up<br> the wooded hillside back behind us<br> till only some few rays still scythe<br> between the treetrunks from the far horizon<br> and are gone.</i></p><p><b>W. D. Snodgrass</b>, born in Pennsylvania in 1926, is the author of more than 20 books of poetry, including <i>The Fuehrer Bunker: The Complete Cycle</i> (BOA, 1995); <i>Each in His Season</i> (BOA, 1993); and <i>Heart's Needle</i> (1959), which won the Pulitzer Prize for Poetry. His other books include <i>To Sound Like Yourself: Essays on Poetr</i>y (BOA, 2002), <i>After-Images: Autobiographical Sketches</i> (BOA, 1999) and six volumes of translation, including <i>Selected Translations</i> (BOA Editions, 1998), which won the Harold Morton Landon Translation Award.</p></p><p>W. D. Snodgrass is author of over twenty books of poetry, two books of literary criticism, and six volumes of translation. Honors include an Ingram Merrill Foundation award, Harold Morton Landon Translation Award, and fellowships from The Academy of American Poets, Ford Foundation, Guggenheim Foundation, and National Endownment for the Arts. He retired from teaching in 1994.Snodgrass made his splash with <i>Heart's Needle</i> (1959), a careful sequence of rhymed poems about his marital troubles and his daughter: the volume helped create so-called "confessional poetry" and won a Pulitzer Prize. Snodgrass gave his later allegiance not to autobiography, but to technique, pursuing, on the one hand, sad, clear, lyrical poems and rueful epigrams, and on the other, ambitious if not quixotic multipoem projects. Among the former, most of the best are brand new: they take on subjects as disparate as twilight fireflies, the war in Iraq, hip replacements and the man who stole Snodgrass's credit card, in styles indebted to poets as different as Andrew Marvell and A.R. Ammons. One Ammons-like work is "The F�hrer Bunker," a cycle of poems about, and spoken by, Joseph Goebbels, Hermann Goering, Adolf Hitler and other members of Hitler's inner circle, completed in 1995. As if in reaction to that grim, ambitious achievement, other pieces here feature graceful measures and a light touch: a quartet of seasonal odes breathes new life into very old topics. This is a judicious selection from a significant oeuvre. <i>(Apr.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

During a recreation of an English Civil War battle outside Bath, Rupert Hope, an academic who's playing a cavalier, and another participant discover a human femur.

Those who do not observe their duties do not deserve their rights. <br><br>--Oriana Fallaci<br>On May 30, 1997, late in the afternoon, Jonathan Levin, a beloved English teacher at a Bronx high school, answered a phone call from Corey Arthur, a former student whose mentor he had been. Arthur pled with him: "I need to see you. It's important." As court records and testimony show, Levin responded to Arthur's plea by inviting him to come to his apartment. When Levin opened his door, however, he found not only Arthur but also another young man, Montoun Hart. Jon Levin's tortured and partially decomposed body was found three days later. <br><br>According to Hart's 11-page confession, he and Arthur misled Levin in order to gain access to his apartment. They then tortured him to make him tell them the PIN for his ATM card.<br>According to Hart, Levin asked, in the final moments of his life, "Why are you doing this to me?" The young men stabbed him in the chest and the back of the neck; they then pulled his head back and cut his throat three times before shooting him in the back of the head with a .22 caliber pistol. They then went to an ATM near his home and withdrew $800.<br><br>Jon Levin was the son of Gerald Levin, then the chief executive officer of media conglomerate Time Warner. Jon had made a decision not to follow his father into corporate America. Instead, he had dedicated his life to helping the disadvantaged and had become a teacher at an inner-city school where most of the kids were poor and black. His payback was brutal.<br><br>The evidence was overwhelming against the two defendants. Corey Arthur's voice begging to see Levin was on the answering machine, his fingerprints were found on the duct tape used to bind Levin to a chair (which Arthur admitted doing), and his girlfriend testified that he had confessed the killing to her. Even Arthur's lawyers admitted their client was present for the robbery, though he always denied pulling the trigger. He insisted it was the older Hart, who had no history with the victim, who had committed the murder. Hart, in his own confession, gave details of the crime that only someone who had been present would know. A witness identified Hart as the person who was making a withdrawal from the ATM at the relevant time.<br><br>It looked like an open-and-shut case of first-degree murder. For many years the homicide law in New York State had classified as first-degree murder only the killing of police officers and prison guards. However, in 1995 the law was amended to include killing "in the course of committing . . . and in furtherance of robbery," and also killing where "the defendant acted in an especially cruel and wanton manner pursuant to a course of conduct intended to inflict and inflicting torture upon the victim prior to the victim's death."7 First-degree murder is a capital crime, punishable by death or by imprisonment with no possibility of parole. Corey Arthur's jury acquitted him of first-degree murder. Instead, he was convicted of second-degree murder and sentenced to 25 years in jail, with eligibility for parole. <br><br>The verdict for Montoun Hart is even more shocking and dangerous. In the face of overwhelming evidence, Hart was found not guilty and freed. What got Hart off? The jury said it was the fact that he looked "wasted" in a picture they saw of him after his six-hour interrogation by the police. In a Herculean intellectual epiphany, they determined he must have been drunk or high when he confessed and therefore--viola^!--his confession didn't count.<br><br> Welcome to a culture where right and wrong have taken such a beating they're no longer recognizable. If you think this debasement of our culture can never really affect you, think again. Today's moral relativism and selfish agendas are moving through the body of society like a cancer, putting all of us at risk.<br>The Death of Right and Wrong<br>Carol Levin, Jon's mother, confessed to a reporter for the New York Post that she thought she was going to vomit in the courtroom as Hart, upon hearing "Not guilty," jumped up and shouted, "Ha! Yes! Thank you!" to the jury.9<br><br>Carol and Gerald Levin are condemned to never seeing Jon again. Each morning, in her longing for the son who will never come home, Carol dabs a drop of his Pierre Cardin cologne on her right wrist. She even hears his voice, she told the Post reporter, her eyes welling with tears as she imagined him telling her, "Mom, go on with your life. There's not much left. Live it."10 <br><br>And Montoun Hart? Courtesy of a culture that is furiously erasing the concepts of right and wrong, he is free--not even on parole, where he would be watched. He is free among people many of whom are probably, like Jon Levin, willing to extend a helping hand to those in need. Many of them probably have ATM cards and remain ignorant of the killer who lives among them, placing them, and their children, at a risk they cannot even fathom.<br><br>The depravity of this story comes not only from Arthur and Hart, but also from a jury that could not, or would not, distinguish right from wrong. Where did this breakdown occur? How have our cultural mores and ethics deteriorated to the point where confessed murderers are allowed to go free? Certainly, injustices have existed for centuries in the United States, and millennia in the rest of the world. As a strict defender of the Constitution, I do not want to see our rights infringed upon by cruel and unusual punishments or by shoddy, deceptive police work. Nor am I one, believe me, to hark back to the days when "men were men" and women were in the kitchen. But I can't help thinking that there was an element in those days that created a certain trustworthiness, a certain stability. In recent decades, in all walks of life, it seems that our society has been hurtling down a slippery slope of selfishness, immorality, and cultural laziness. Enron, the Catholic Church, the Clinton White House--these are just grander instances of the kind of poor judgment and willful self-indulgence witnessed every day on the freeway, at the local diner, around the watercooler. <br><br>So how did we arrive at the state we're in? To help explain, let me offer another story.<br>Killer as Hero<br>In the early morning hours of December 9, 1981, Philadelphia police officer Daniel Faulkner11 stopped one William Cook because he was driving the wrong way on a one-way street with his lights off. Before Faulkner got out of his patrol car, he called for a police wagon to back him up. <br><br>When the reinforcements arrived, they found Cook's brother, former Black Panther Mumia Abu-Jamal (born Wesley Cook), lying in the street, wounded, with his shoulder holster empty. A gun registered to him was a few feet away, with five empty chambers. Police would later learn that Abu-Jamal had not arrived on the scene with his brother; he was sitting in his cab across the street when Faulkner pulled Cook over. <br><br>Faulkner also lay on the street, dying from five bullet wounds,12 one of which was to his back. Three witnesses specifically identified Abu-Jamal as the man who fired all the shots at Faulkner and testified that once Faulkner was down, Abu-Jamal stood over him and unloaded more shots directly into his groin and head.<br><br>At the hospital, Daniel Faulkner lay on a gurney in the emergency room as doctors and nurses worked in vain to revive him. Abu-Jamal was brought to the same hospital, kicking, screaming, and cursing. During his trial, hospital security guard Priscilla Durham testified that she was standing just a few inches from him and that as he struggled on the floor with hospital workers and police, he cursed Faulkner and said he hoped his victim would die.13 <br><br>Abu-Jamal was eventually found guilty, after courtroom antics that included fighting with the judge and making political speeches. With overwhelming evidence against him and because of the special circumstance of killing a police officer on duty, during the penalty phase the jury of ten whites and two blacks deliberated for less than two hours and came back with a sentence of death.<br><br>So far, our justice system seemed to be working. Yes, we lost a good man that winter day in Philadelphia, but his murderer was where he belonged--on Death Row. But of course, in our world of growing moral relativism, that could not remain the case. Mumia Abu-Jamal, instead of being regarded as the criminal he is, has become a cause celebre for the Left--a martyred idealist, if you will.<br>Years of the Beast<br>The drumbeat to "Free Mumia" began almost immediately after his sentencing. By 1994 it was a favorite slogan for fashionable leftists. With the assistance of international television, the Mumia craze swept the world. Time reported his supporters' contention that the "real killer" had been spotted running from the scene; National Public Radio signed Abu-Jamal to do reports on prison life from behind bars (although the network cancelled the contract in response to overwhelming public pressure); Leonard Weinglass, the leftist attorney who is handling Abu-Jamal's appeal (and who had entered the national spotlight by defending the Chicago Seven and Patty Hearst's kidnappers), rounded up a herd of celebrities for the cause, including Paul Newman, Susan Sarandon, Ed Asner, and Ossie Davis.14 <br><br>In 2000, the city of Paris, France, in all its anti-American socialistic glory, made Abu-Jamal an honorary citizen (a status last accorded to Pablo Picasso in 1971). There have been protests supporting Abu-Jamal from Japan to South Africa; "benefit" rock concerts have even been held to raise money for him. Also in 2000, Francois Mitterrand's widow, Danielle, visited Abu-Jamal in prison. Norman Mailer and Nelson Mandela piped up, contending that Abu-Jamal's trial was a "miscarriage of justice...</p><h2>Belonging: A Culture of Place</h2><p>Please Read Notes: Brand New, International Softcover Edition, Printed in black and white pages, minor self wear on the cover or pages, Sale restriction may be printed on the book, but Book name, contents, and author are exactly same as Hardcover Edition.

Ed Murrow, introducing an assemblage of voices in the volume This I Believe, sounded a claxon.<br>&nbsp;<br>It is an old story yet ever-contemporary. In 1791, Tom Paine, the most eloquent visionary of the American Revolution, sounded off:<br>&nbsp;<br>Freedom has been hunted around the globe; reason was considered as rebellion; and the slavery of fear made man afraid to think. But such is the irresistible nature of truth is that all it asks, and all it wants, is the liberty of appearing . . . In such a situation, man becomes what he ought to be. He sees his species not with the inhuman idea of a natural enemy, but as kindred . . .<br>&nbsp;<br>It is the pursuit of this truth that appears to be the common tenor of all the voices you hear in this new volume.<br>&nbsp;<br>We need not dwell on the old question: What is truth? What you see with your own eyes may differ from the received official truth. So old Pilate had only one decision to make: find the man guilty or he, the judge, will be sent back to the boondocks. Pilate did what any well-behaved hack would do. Though he had his hands scrubbed and rub-a-dub-dubbed with Ivory soap, 99.44% pure, he could not erase the awful truth of the dirt on his hands. Though Pilate&#x2019;s wife pleaded for a show of mercy, he made an objective decision.<br>&nbsp;<br>In our time, James Cameron, the nonpareil of British journalism, dealt with the matter in his own way. &#x201c;I cannot remember how often I&#x2019;ve been challenged for disregarding the fundamental tenet of honest journalism, which is objectivity.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>His bearing witness in North Vietnam during that war convinced him, despite all official Washington arguments to the contrary, that North Vietnam was inhabited by human beings. He was condemned for being non-objective and having a point of view. Cameron confesses, &#x201c;I may not have always been satisfactorily balanced; I always tended to argue that objectivity was of less importance than the truth.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>Errol Morris, film documentarian, who appears in this book, shares the obstinancy of Cameron: &#x201c;Truth is not relative. . . . It may be elusive or hidden. People may wish to disregard it. But there is such a thing as truth.&#x201d; What really possesses Morris is the pursuit of the truth: &#x201c;Trying to figure out what has really happened, trying to figure out how things really are.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>The chase is what it&#x2019;s all about. The quarry is, as always, the truth.<br>&nbsp;<br>On a small patch of Sag Harbor dirt is a simple stone easily passed by. Nelson Algren is buried there and his epitaph is simple: &#x201c;The journey is all.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>Andrew Sullivan, editor of The New Republic, who appears in this volume, has a similar vision. He and Algren may have differed considerably in their political views, yet here, as to fundamental belief, they were as one. &#x201c;I believe in the pursuit of happiness. Not its attainment, nor its final definition, but its pursuit.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>I&#x2019;d be remiss with no mention of Helen Keller, whose vision we saw and whose voice we heard fifty years ago, a deaf, dumb, and blind child. It was her sense of wonder and her pursuit of truth which she saw much more clearly than sighted people, and heard much more clearly than hearing folk. They were voices in need throughout the world she heard so vividly. Above all it was her faith that the human being was better than his/her behavior.<br>&nbsp;<br>What I believe is a compote of these ingredients. Yes I do have a point of view which I express much too frequently, I suspect. And yet there&#x2019;s always that uncertainty. In all my adventures among hundreds of Americans I have discovered that the rule of thumb does not work. I&#x2019;ve been astonished too often by those I&#x2019;ve visited: ordinary Americans, who at times, are extraordinary in their insights and dreams.<br>&nbsp;<br>I find the labels &#x201c;liberal&#x201d; and &#x201c;conservative&#x201d; of little meaning. Our language has become perverted along with the thoughts of many of us.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Liberal&#x201d; according to any dictionary is defined as the freedom to speak out, no matter what the official word may be, and the right to defend all others who speak out whether or not they agree with you. &#x201c;Conservative&#x201d; is the word I&#x2019;ve always associated with conserving our environment from pollution, ensuring that our water is potable and our grass green. So I declare myself a radical conservative. Radical, as in getting to the root of things. Pasteur was a radical. Semmelweiss was a radical. &#x201c;Wash your hands,&#x201d; he declared to doctors and nurses. He may have wound up in a nuthouse, but he pursued the truth, found it, and saved untold millions of lives. I am a conservative in that I&#x2019;m out to conserve the blue of the sky, the freshness of the air of which we have less and less, the First Amendment of the Bill of Rights, and whatever semblance of sanity we may have left. As for faith, I&#x2019;ve always called myself an agnostic. Were Ambrose Bierce alive today, he would no doubt have added to his Devil&#x2019;s Dictionary: &#x201c;An agnostic is a cowardly atheist.&#x201d; Perhaps. But perhaps I do believe there is a God deposited in each of us ever since the Big Bang.<br>&nbsp;<br>I secretly envy those who believe in the hereafter and with it the idea that they may once again meet dear ones. They cannot prove beyond a reasonable doubt that there is such a place. Neither can I disprove it. I cannot find the bookmaker willing to take my bet on it. How will one who guesses right be able to collect his winnings? So speaking on behalf of the bookies of the world, all bets are off.<br>&nbsp;<br>Maybe the poet Keats was right after all in the &#x201c;Ode on a Grecian Urn.&#x201d; He envied the fortunate youth who is forever chasing his love, never quite catching her. The pursuit is all.<br>&nbsp;<br>And yet there is something which I believe with no uncertainty. There is something we can do while we&#x2019;re alive and breathing on this planet. It is to become an activist in this pursuit of a world in which it would be easier for people to behave decently. (I am paraphrasing Dorothy Day, who founded the Catholic Worker Movement.)<br>&nbsp;<br>Being an activist is self-explanatory: you act; you take part in something outside yourself. You join with others, who may astonish you in thinking precisely as you do on the subjects, say, of war, civil liberties, human rights.<br>&nbsp;<br>My belief came into being during the most traumatic moment in American history, the Great Depression of the 1930s. I remember seeing pots and pans and bedsteads and mattresses on the sidewalks. A family had just been evicted and there was an individual cry of despair, multiplied by millions. But that community had a number of people on that very block, electricians and plumbers and carpenters, who appeared that very evening, and moved the household goods back into the flat where they had been. They turned on the gas, they fixed the plumbing. It was a community in action accomplishing something.<br>&nbsp;<br>Albert Einstein once observed that westerners have a feeling the individual loses his freedom if he joins, say, a union or any group. Precisely the opposite is the case. Once you join others, even though at first your mission fails, you become a different person, a much stronger one. You feel that you really count, you discover your strength as an individual because you have along the way discovered others share in what you believe, you are not alone; and thus a community is formed. I am paraphrasing Einstein. I love to do that; nobody dares contradict me.<br>&nbsp;<br>So, my credo consists of the pursuit and the act. One without the other is self-indulgence. This I believe.<br>&nbsp;<br>Copyright � 2006 by This I Believe, Inc.

Today, The Diary of a Young Girl has sold over 25 million copies world-wide. This edition accompanies the 2009 BBC TV series written by Deborah Moggach.It is one of the most celebrated and enduring books of the last century and it remains a deeply admired testament to the indestructible nature of human spirit.Anne Frank and her family fled the horrors of Nazi occupation by hiding in the back of a warehouse in Amsterdam for two years with another family and a German dentist. Aged thirteen when she went into the secret annexe, Anne kept a diary. She movingly revealed how the eight people living under these extraordinary conditions coped with hunger, the daily threat of discovery and death and being cut off from the outside world, as well as petty misunderstandings and the unbearable strain of living like prisoners.The Diary of a Yong Girl is a timeless true story to be rediscovered by each new generation. For young readers and adults it continues to bring to life Anne&#39;s extraordinary courage and struggle throughout her ordeal.&#39;One of the greatest books of the century&#39; Guardian&#39;A modern classic&#39; The Times&#39;Rings down the decades as the most moving testament to the persecution of innocence&#39; Daily Mail&#39;Astonishing and excruciating.

She died in Bergen-Belsen, three months short of her sixteenth birthday.</p><p>A beloved classic since its initial publication in 1947, this vivid, insightful journal is a fitting memorial to the gifted Jewish teenager who died at Bergen-Belsen, Germany, in 1945. Born in 1929, Anne Frank received a blank diary on her 13th birthday, just weeks before she and her family went into hiding in Nazi-occupied Amsterdam. Her marvelously detailed, engagingly personal entries chronicle 25 trying months of claustrophobic, quarrelsome intimacy with her parents, sister, a second family, and a middle-aged dentist who has little tolerance for Anne's vivacity. The diary's universal appeal stems from its riveting blend of the grubby particulars of life during wartime (scant, bad food; shabby, outgrown clothes that can't be replaced; constant fear of discovery) and candid discussion of emotions familiar to every adolescent (everyone criticizes me, no one sees my real nature, when will I be loved?). Yet Frank was no ordinary teen: the later entries reveal a sense of compassion and a spiritual depth remarkable in a girl barely 15. Her death epitomizes the madness of the Holocaust, but for the millions who meet Anne through her diary, it is also a very individual loss. <i>--Wendy Smith</i>For almost fifty years, Anne Frank&#39;s diary has moved millions with its testament to the human spirit&#39;s indestructibility, but readers have never seen the full text of this beloved book--until now. This new translation, performed by Winona Ryder, restores nearly one third of Anne&#39;s entries excised by her father in previous editions, revealing her burgeoning sexuality, her stormy relationship with her mother, and more.</p><h2>From the Beast to the Blonde: On Fairy Tales and Their Tellers</h2><p>From classical enchantresses to Mother Goose to the Brothers Grimm, a cultural study of fairy tales shows what they reveal about the changing status of women, the ways of men, racial prejudice, and other serious subjects.</p><p>One dare not even call it seminal, yet in this ground-breaking work, English novelist and historian Marina Warner casts herself as the female Joseph Campbell in a fascinating and lively book that opens with the observation that &#34;storytelling makes women thrive -- and not exclusively women,&#34; and then lifts the veil on both tellers and tales ranging from Sibyl to the late, great Angela Carter, from Lot&#39;s daughters to Disney&#39;s &#34;Little Mermaid.&#34; She finds a not-so-hidden history of women, sex, power, fear -- and even healing -- lurking therein.

As punishment for making man as powerful as gods, Prometheus was bound to a rock; every day his immortal body was devoured by a giant eagle.

It was our job, or at least the job of the scientists and programmers, to develop animation tools that would create high-end movies indistinguishable from live action.<br>Joseph Jennings&#x2019;s childhood dream was to make new movies with old-time stars. He wanted Humphrey Bogart and Peter Lorre side by side with Rudolph Valentino, Myrna Loy, Marlon Brando, and Natalie Portman. These new <i>classics</i>, he envisioned, could be made in small laboratories by purely technical means. Had we been successful, the stock in JTE would have been worth billions. Instead, we were secretly vilified, physically quarantined, and warned, under threat of death, not to create documents such as this one. Writing this memoir, my second act of true rebellion, is necessary in spite of the danger because there must be some record of what really transpired in case the government gets to me before the Alto arrive.<br>But I don&#x2019;t want to get ahead of myself.<br>My name is Joshua Winterland. I suppose you could call me a failed writer. Failed is a harsh word but valid in this case, because all my life I wanted to be a playwright. I&#x2019;ve written thirty-seven plays that have each been rejected by every theater, playwriting competition, and creative writing school in the country.<br>I am thirty-nine years old and have been writing since the age of nine.<br>When I realized that I&#x2019;d never be successful, or even produced, as a playwright I began work as a technical writer for a succession of various companies and institutions in California&#x2019;s Silicon Valley. I was the guy who wrote the manuals for new hard- and software. My day&#x2019;s work was to help consumers figure out what tab to hit and where to look up the serial number, how to register online or over the telephone, and what safety precautions to take before turning on a new system.<br>My fate was recast when the country went into a serious economic recession and, coincidentally, my girlfriend, Lena Berston, woke up one day to realize that she was in love with my childhood friend Ralph Tracer.<br>Lena told me one morning, before I was off to work at Interdyne, that Ralph had called because he was coming in from San Francisco that evening and she had offered to cook dinner for the three of us. I thought this was odd because Lena rarely cooked on weeknights, and she had always said that Ralph wasn&#x2019;t <i>her kind of person</i>.<br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s not that I don&#x2019;t like him,&#x201d; she&#x2019;d said more than once, &#x201c;but he just doesn&#x2019;t interest me.&#x201d;<br>I didn&#x2019;t give it any serious thought. Ralph was a good guy. I&#x2019;d known him since junior high school in Oakland. He was from a different neighborhood but we made an early bond. We&#x2019;d talked to each other at least once a week since I was thirteen years old, sharing our boyhood dreams. I planned to be a playwright and he wanted, in the worst way, to lose his virginity.<br>Our goals alone spoke volumes about the value of reduced expectations.<br><br>&nbsp;<br>Copyright � 2012 by Walter Mosley<br></p><h2>Australian Womens Weekly Cookbook</h2><p>**Very Good - Lite wear to cover - Reading pages clean**.
